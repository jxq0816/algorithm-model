__label__2	Probably the biggest thing about Wild Rebels that hurts it the most is the hero . He's got LOSER written all over him ,  but that doesn't stop him from  " getting the girl . "  Probably one of the world's worst race drivers imaginable ,  he decides to stop racing after he crashes his car . Well ,  his new job is racing still ,  as a bunch of biker types pick him to drive their getaway car as they commit crimes . There's nothing really to endear you to Rod ,  even the situation he's thrown into is pretty stupid . In the end ,  at the lighthouse scene ,  you'll wish that Rod gets killed with all the bikers . Get this :  He's shot twice ,  once in the arm and once in the leg ,  and still manages to crawl up the stairs a little . If only Jeeter had better aim ...  Avoid this one unless you're watching the MST3K version.
__label__4	 " Wild Rebels "  was probably a fun second film at a drive in movie triple feature 40 years ago . It hasn't aged very well ,  but it was never meant to age well ;  it was obviously intended to be disposable ,  forgettable fun from its inception . Taken on that level ,  it's a good example of the biker flick genre .  Several elements help distinguish it from the dozens of similar films being churned out at the same time . The  ' hero ' ,   ' Rod Tillman '  ( Steve Alaimo )  comes off as somewhat of an unimpressive  ' Everyman ' - he's not especially brave ,  tough ,  talented ,  or handsome  ( although he does win a fight with a tough biker gang member halfway into the film ,  and the girl gang member chooses to help him over her fellow gang member at the end of the film )  . The soundtrack is quite well done ,  featuring a nice  ' Ventures ' style bass / drum riff that keeps things moving and saxophones and brass charts that pep things up quite a bit . And although the script is pretty shallow ,  all the actors inhabit their cardboard characters convincingly and with a fair amount of energy .  There are plenty of careless technical gaffes :  terrible  ' day-for-night ' scenes that occur in broad daylight ,  squealing tires in a swamp ,  fire sirens mistakenly stuck on the soundtrack instead of police sirens ,  a bank sign made of duct tape on a ceiling tile ,  a Luger that sounds like a Winchester 30-06 ,  shotgun blasts that cut down people 100 yards away ,  a detective killing a biker on a 3rd floor landing from the ground with a revolver with a 2 inch barrel .  There are a whole bunch of goofy story elements  :  Linda  ( the girl gang member )  disables a bank guard with a drug-filled syringe ,  the final shootout takes place inside a lighthouse  (  !  )  ,  police roadblocks don't actually block roads ,  the police apparently never heard of ducking ,  and the police detectives apparently never heard of planting bugs or having their undercover guy wearing a wire .  But the plot chugs along ,  the cameraman knows what he is doing ,  the pacing in most scenes is pretty good ,  and there are some nice ,  zippy one liners and dialog exchanges here and there that keep the energy level up .  ( My favorite :   " Man ,  you're messing with private stock !   ( ie ,  Linda )  "  So no ,  don't seek this one out or anything ,  but if a copy of the MST version should fall in your hands ,  you should have some good ,  shallow fun watching it . Vastly superior to  " Five the Hard Way "  or  " The Hellcats "  or even  ' Girl In Gold Boots '  ( three other MST covered counter culture movies ) .
__label__3	If you decide to watch Wild Rebels ,  don't expect anything deep and meaningful . If you're looking for a film that explores the relationships and structure of a motorcycle gang ,  Wild Rebels is the wrong movie . If you're looking for an expose on the breakdown of the American educational system and the problem of juvenile delinquency ,  Wild Rebels is the wrong movie . If you're looking for a movie that examines how undermanned rural police departments are when facing a well-financed ,  well-organized gang ,  Wild Rebels is the wrong movie . But if you're looking for an absurd movie filled with scene after scene of unintentional humor ,  horrendous acting ,  a paper-thin plot ,  and community theater style production values ,  Wild Rebels is the right movie .  Wild Rebels is the story of a down-on-his-luck stock-car driver named Rod Tillman  ( Steve Alaimo )  . After a fiery crash  ( which Rod walks away from completely unscathed despite having only a cotton pants and a London Fog style jacket for protection )  ,  Rod decides to give it up . With no plan for his future other than to wander aimless through the back-roads of the South ,  he stumbles on the Satan's Angels motorcycle gang  ( a gang being three of the stupidest guys to ever zip up a leather jacket and a woman they seem to share )  . This group of hoodlums spends their time terrorizing a rural town in Florida by committing such atrocities as stealing a newspaper from a neighbor's mailbox . These bumbling idiots need someone to act as their driver during some larger crimes they have planned . Apparently ,  these three Einsteins can only drive vehicles with two tires ,  not four . So they recruit Rod to perform feats of daring that only an experienced stunt driver would be capable of like keeping the car in the middle of a gravel road during a low-speed chase . Eventually ,  they hold-up a bank ,  get into the aforementioned low-speed chase ,  and have the lamest gun battle with the police ever put on film . I could go on forever ,  but you get the idea .  I hate the term  " so bad it's good "  ,  but that seems to aptly describe Wild Rebels.
__label__1	I just caught  " Wild Rebels "  on one of the  " Mystery Science Theatre 3000 "  archive compilations ,  and this movie was so bad even the MST3K crew couldn't make it entertaining . There are some MST3K  " targets "  that were films whose concepts were so dippy they couldn't possibly have been good movies  ( like  " The Green Slime "  )  ,  and others whose basic premises could have been made into genuinely entertaining films if their filmmakers hadn't bobbled them in the execution .  " Wild Rebels "  is a film whose basic premise DID make a good movie three years earlier ,  when Don Siegel directed his remake of  " The Killers "  at Universal . Both films are about a failed racing driver who's seduced by a femme fatale into driving the getaway car in a robbery masterminded by the woman's boyfriend -- only in  " The Killers "  the driver was John Cassavetes ,  the woman was Angie Dickinson and the criminal mastermind  ( cast wildly but successfully against type in what turned out to be his final film )  was Ronald Reagan . Steve Alaimo ,  Bobbie Byers and Willie Pastrano are quite a comedown !  But what REALLY makes  " Wild Rebels "  an awful movie is the direction by William Grefé  ( note the accent over the final  " e ,  "  present in his on-screen credit )  ,  which has absolutely no sense of pace whatsoever and seems to let every shot run at least half again as long as it needs to to make its dramatic point . It's only a pity that someone didn't do a mocking commentary on this movie now  ( in 2009 )  ;  the comparison between Steve Alaimo's hairdo and Rod Blagojevich's would have been irresistible ! 
__label__2	This is basically your run of the mill violent biker flick complete with nifty slangs ,  crashes ,  and music . OK ,  so just slangs and crashes . It's a slight notch above much of the other fare featured on MST3K but it's still the equivalent of driving a nail into your kneecap :  slow and painful . To give away plot would exhaust my energy so I'll just say you're better off skipping this one.
__label__3	Wild Rebels is fun in a bad way ,  but also frustrating due to the actual good ,  or at least workable ,  elements in the story . It deals with a race car driver  ( Steve Alaimo )  who gets mixed up in a group of bikers called Satan's Angels ,  who hang around a lot until they decide to rob a bank . Meanwhile Alaimo also gets recruited by the cops to report back to them what the Angels are up to and where they'll rob next . It's not even that the film is really too  ' dated ' ,  though it does of course carry the significantly crude and stupid music in the film  ( from the band on stage in one scene ,  to Alaimo  " performing "  if you could call that drek that ,  to the regular generic score )  .   It's just that there's not more care taken by the filmmaker into putting a little more logic ,  direction ,  and better actors for the parts . As it is I didn't have a major disliking towards the film ,  as I did with the Hellcats ,  but it almost left me a little indifferent to it all ,  too . What could come through as being unpredictable only comes through with stupid things like the name of the Florida town  (  ' Citrusville ' ho-ho )  . So it's not completely un-worthy then of its Mystery Science Theater 3000 status as of late . The commentary is good on the movie ,  even if once or twice I almost wanted to hear what the characters on screen were saying in case it might have some worth . Wild Rebels might be more of a good time if you've got a six-pack and low expectations ,  but as it is I wouldn't watch it again.
__label__1	Legendary pop star Steve Alaimo  (  " Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying "  )  stars as an unlikable stock car racer whose career has hit the skids  ( ha ha )  because he constantly crashes his car  ( or as he laments ,   " I'm tired of being run down by every grease monkey that gets behind the wheel "  )  . He falls into a bad crowd of humorously inept Nazi bikers ,  improbably named Jeeter ,  Banjo ,  Fats ,  and ,  er ,  Linda . Fats is the most likable of the bunch ;  he took a surfboard to the back of the skull and now only communicates through grunts ,  sort of a Harley Davidson Leatherface .  Anyway ,  Steve is fooled by the cops into catching the dastardly crooks in the middle of one of their bank robberies . The gang only robs banks for  " kicks ,  man "  . I guess they give the money to charity . Steve fails constantly ,  the bikers get greasier ,  and the whole thing never comes off as daring because it's so dull . This movie looks like it was filmed through a grease-soaked paper towel . Not since  " Necromantic "  has a movie so trampled my soul .  The guy who played Fats went on to direct  " Deranged "  ,  the Ed Gein biopic starring Robert Blossom .  Anyway ,  in summary :  Wild Rebels :  Hilarious on MST3K ,  dreadful everywhere else.
__label__2	Oh dear !  Oh dear !  Oh dear !   To think that films such as this were made ,  and probably enjoyed by thousands at drive-ins really boggles the mind . How innocent we were in those days .  To put it bluntly ,  this film is crap . The hero is so wet you can hear his squishy damp footsteps in every scene . My Lord ,  but he's just one of a whole slew of awful ,  awful actors that appear in this turkey . No wonder MST3K picked it . The story ,  such as it is ,  centres around a stock car driver  ( who is so incompetent ,  you really believe it is the actor driving the car )  that he gives up and  " gets in with the wrong crowd "  Oooooh !  Scary stuff . However ,  the wrong crowd turn out to be the biker equivalent of The Three Stooges and their  " hand-me round "  slut of a biker chick . As an example of how lame this whole thing is ,  the writers obviously wracked their brains to come up with a frightening name for the biker gang - if four people can be called a gang ,  that is . The result ?  The gang is called Satan's Angels !  I kid you not .  Such dire acting and dialogue ,  along with ridiculous scenes ,  make for a wonderful beer and chips movie . But otherwise its just the worst kind of rubbish .  As I said . Once ,  this may have been considered good . But today it just makes you laugh  ( and cringe )  with every minute that goes by . Avoid it except for a good laugh . And make sure you're more than half-drunk too ! 
__label__4	I completely forgot that I'd seen this within a couple of days ,  which is pretty revealing in itself . The umpteenth version of Gaston  ' Phantom of the Opera ' Leroux's locked-door country-house mystery ,  I had heard that it was an engaging and witty update . So it appeared from the likable title sequence and a few neat touches in the opening scene ,  but the film very quickly ground to a halt and became vaguely tedious and wholly unsatisfying .  As a mystery the major problem is that it is fundamentally unsolvable by the audience :  like the worst Agatha Christies ,  it depends on a character appearing in the final act with a wealth of background information that we have not been privy to . As a film ,  be it comedy or thriller ,  the crucial problem is that characterisation is almost non-existent . With the exception of the killer ,  everyone is a face-value version of the typical suspects in the typical country-house murder story - reporter ,  endangered heiress ,  suspicious fiancé ,  scatterbrained scientist father  ( a surprisingly poor Michel Lonsdale )  ,  etc . There's no depth and little of interest ,  and the frequently over-ripe or misjudged performances don't help . You frankly don't care about anyone in it ,  so there's no jeopardy or suspense . Only Claude Rich and ,  in the last reel ,  Pierre Arditi get anything to work with ,  and only in the last reel does the film get close to a sense of resonance that is too fleeting to be really effective .  For the rest ,  we get endless exposition and a couple of ineffective would-be comic set pieces  ( a promising one with a photographer trapped inside a grandfather clock is just too poorly thought through to pay off )  ,  with Dennis Podalydes reduced to Irving the Explainer for the last third of the picture . I'm not fond of country-house movies or Agatha Christie style whodunits ,  so those who are might cit it a lot more slack ,  but I found it a poor show . As Rich says when the mystery is revealed ,   " It's all rather something of a disappointment . " 
__label__3	A few buddies and myself have the strange hobby of seeking out really horrendous and utterly obscure  ( for a good reason )  horror flicks and then subsequently watching them under the influence of mind-broadening consumer goods like alcohol and / or soft drugs . Surely a lot of people do this ,  but they watch movies like the  " Godzilla "  remake ,  whereas we torment our eyes and brains with stuff like  " The Loch Ness Horror "  . And ,  eureka ,  this is a prototypic bad movie !  We open traditionally ,  with bag pipes music during the opening credits . This is ,  of course ,  to emphasize extra to us dumb viewers that the story is supposed to take place in the Scottish highlights and not in director Larry Buchanan's birthplace Texas . For that exact same reason ,  the cast members are seemingly also instructed to overact tremendously and talk with talk with atrocious accents . The American marine biologist Prof . George Sanderson arrives in Loch Ness with some brand new and highly sophisticated sonar equipment to track down the whereabouts of the legendary monster in the lake . Meanwhile ,  there are many other parties hanging around the lake ,  like a group of kids on a Science Camp  ( what a boring way to spend your vacation )  ,  retired army generals looking for a Luftwaffe plane that crashed in the lake during WWII and a bunch of thieves and failed scientists that are steeling the monster's egg . You would think that these numerous sub plots bring some diversity and excitement in the plot ,  but unfortunately that's not the case .  " Loch Ness Horror "  is an overall boring flick with only a couple of noteworthy elements . The monster itself ,  for example ,  is a delightfully cheesy creation with cute eyes and a smoky breath . His teeth also glow in the dark ,  which is quite useful when you're dumb enough to go out on a boat ride in the middle of the night . Near the end of the film ,  the remaining cast members were more interested in the lost Luftwaffe plane than in the monster ,  so it was about time to wrap it up .  " Loch Ness Horror "  is carefully recommended in case you're a fan of bad B-movies from the 80's ,  but be advised that it contains an overload of senseless dialogs and a bizarrely rushed ending that makes it look as if the film suddenly ran out of budget.
__label__3	What can I say about a movie as bad as this ?  The people who made this movie ,  didn't even try to make the monster in it look realistic . You never see more than its head ,  and the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except for when it opens it mouth to roar . And the sound they used for the roaring is the best part . At many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a TIE fighter flying over !  I couldn't believe that when I first heard it and had to rewind several times to make it sink in . Other than the terrible looking monster and the noises it makes ,  there isn't much more to this film except for a few corny attack scenes and the crazy Scotsman attacking the kids trying to have an intimate moment in his castle . Still ,  it's watchable if you like this sort of trash . I know I do....
__label__1	I think this is one of those few movies that I want to rate it as low as possible just to pay it a compliment .  I haven't seen this movie in about 25 years ,  so I really can't say that much about it . It still seems to be very hard to find on video . But I remember my brother and I stumbled upon it somewhere in the toxic brew of late night UHF channel television of the mid 1980s when I was about 10 years old . So I've never actually seen the beginning of the movie ,  but I saw most of it . The first thing I remember is this couple is sneaking out of a campsite and they're rowing to an island to make out ,  and then they get attacked by an insane Scotsman in a kilt with an axe !  They manage to escape from him but get attacked by the Loch Ness Monster ,  which in this movie is just a head and a neck with no body . The eyes and the mouth of the monster don't even move ,  it looks like a piñata .  I mean I had just literally never seen anything on this magnitude before and it totally blew my mind . I had seen some bad movies on TV in the early 80s but I had never seen something so totally inept and so casually and thoughtlessly constructed that it seemed like the people who made it spent less time and effort on it than we did watching it . I had already seen some of the Troma films and that type of thing that tries to deliberately be  " campy "  ,  but this was the pure and real stuff and it was my first encounter with truly great bad film-making . This movie was like the last gasp of the drive-in era and I caught a whiff of it just in time . Actually when we were watching it ,  we couldn't figure out if it was made in the 50s or the 70s . Turns out it came out just a few years before I saw it .  Later I came into contact with Mystery Science Theater and found out about a lot of the old B movies and serials ,  but I had already seen it in this movie . The movie is so funny that I had never even laughed that hard at the Monty Python crew or Bill Murray or any comedian . After seeing this movie I was always trying to search for the  " good bad "  movies and I got a lot of my friends into it . But this movie was and basically is an impossible one to find . I never really found out what it even was or who Larry Buchanan was until the 1990s when IMDb took off and the internet took off and information started getting passed around . But this movie still needs to be discovered by a lot of others who might appreciate its transcendentally bad qualities . Look for it.
__label__1	OMG ,  another bad film by Larry Buchanan . That guy did not learn to stop ,  did he ?  First ,  he gives us zero budget sci-fi movies and lies about famous dead people ,  and now he is exploiting the Loch Ness Monster as being vicious .  The  " plot "  is basically about some southerners of the USA pretending to be Scottish camping out at Loch Ness . Alas ,  out on the fishing hole ,  oops ,  I mean lake of Loch Ness ,  there is a killer inflatable monster that clams itself to be Nessie ,  going out of its way to kill people for no apparent reason .  I am surprised that the crew of MST3K never heard of this movie . Yes ,  it is that bad too.
__label__1	Something strange is happening in Loch Ness . The water is crystal clear ,  nor cold . A giant robotic plastic monster emerges and kills Scots !  What is this movie ?  !  First ,  I love reading stories about Nessie ,  sea monsters in general . When i saw this for sale ,  i thought it was a cheap rip off of jaws . No . It was terrible !  The story was pointless ,  acting was 100 %  garbage ,  the only up side was the cool mechanical Nessie they used . It was full of inaccuracy ,  wrong locations ,  and bad everything . Not worth your while ,  just leave it on the shelf  ( or garbage can )  you found it on . On second note ,  This film was shot in Cailifornia ,  not Loch Ness ,  a major diss to Nessie fans.
__label__1	**Possible Spoilers Ahead**  Whenever fans of bad movies congregate for more than a few minutes ,  a name that invariably comes up is that of Larry Buchanan . This amazing director has given us remakes of other turkeys  ( ZONTAR THE THING FROM VENUS )  ,  cheap-jack crime dramas like A BULLET FOR PRETTY BOY ,  and tawdry conspiracy flicks like DOWN ON US and GOODBYE NORMA JEAN . THE LOCH NESS HORROR is a humdinger to say the least . Overlooking the fact that Loch Ness is extremely long and narrow ,  Larry filmed this howler on a wide and round California lake . Early on ,  the film boasts some dazzling  ( for the budget )  underwater photography and creates some atmosphere in spite of itself . Then it degenerates into windy dialogue uttered by no-name actors with lapsing Scottish accents ,  not to mention a soundtrack that will do nothing for the much-maligned bagpipe . At one point ,  campers sing  " You Take The High Road ,  I'll Take The Low Road ,  "  just to throw in one more Scottish cliche . If Scottish people ever decide to jump on the Political Correctness bandwagon they'll sue Larry Buchanan over this film ,  his surname notwithstanding . The monster looks like a giant papier-mache puppet and it makes the dragon in Beanie  &  Cecil look terrifying by comparison . In one unforgettable scene Nessie takes to land and ,  to evade some patrolling soldiers ,  the fifty-foot long critter tries to hide behind a tree-and the soldiers don't see it !  THE LOCH NESS HORROR is a true mind-boggler that must be seen-several times--to be believed.
__label__4	Pick a stereotype ,  any stereotype  ( whether racial ,  sexual ,  cultural ,  etc . )  ,  and I bet you'll find it in Wassup Rockers . Do you think that all Hispanic teenage boys are stupid ,  hairy ,  inarticulate ,  and dirty troublemakers ?  Are Hispanic girls sex-crazed ,  easy ,  ass-baring sluts ?  Do Black people all want to start fights and carry guns ?  Do all gay people throw themed parties with pink drinks and ask young boys to model for them ?  Are all White teenage girls rich ,  stuck-up princesses who are bored with White teenage boys and are looking for something a little more dangerous ?  If you answered  " yes "  to any of the previous questions ,  you ,  my friend ,  are a bigot ,  and you will LOVE Wassup Rockers .  Director Larry Clark likes to shock his audiences  ( I was 15 years old the first time I saw Kids and I think that's why I'm still a virgin )  ,  but Wassup Rockers isn't shocking it's just bad . He tries to be edgy and realistic with his minimal dialog and body-hair close-ups ,  but these characters and this story are completely unrealistic .  Simply put ,  Wassup Rockers is a teenage boy's fantasy . What 14-year-old boy doesn't want to be a skater who gets in trouble ,  crashes parties ,  drinks 40s ,  and is told by the hot ,  rich ,  White girl that his uncircumcised penis  " looks dangerous ?  "  Besides that demographic ,  I really don't know who's going to enjoy this film.
__label__1	It starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other Clark movies like Kids ,  Bully ,  etc . But then just as quickly ,  it unravels into a direction-less mess . Who is the main character ?  Is this a serious film or some Gregg Araki-esquire over the top goofy film ?  Is this a skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted ?  I have no clue . I found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end . I kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came . I cut a good 20 minutes out of the movie by fast forwarding through the pointless skate scenes . Yes ,  it illustrates the changing landscape between the have's have not's . I got it way back in the beginning . Kids and Bully was done in such a way that I actually felt like I was observing the realities of that group of friends . Wassup felt very staged ,  poorly constructed and ever worse acting . Teenage Caveman ,  which Larry didn't write but did direct ,  was terrible . But at least it felt like it was suppose to be a terrible movie that didn't take itself seriously . Wassup Rockers was just plain bad.
__label__1	There's nothing to say except I want my time back that this movie took from me . I'm not racist against Latinos . Hell ,  I'm half Brazilian . I loved the movie Kids . It doesn't make any sense . These kids just go around and do nothing . They're not even good at skating . The whole time I'm just waiting for something ,  anything ,  to happen !  but it doesn't . NOTHING happens the whole movie . Did I mention they suck at skating . I might make a movie called beat up rockers ,  and the whole premise will be about kicking the sh*t out of poser moron punks like these kids . I'm not even going to get into it ,  this movie sucks . Please do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you come in contact with it so some other poor soul won't make the same mistake.
__label__1	Larry Clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director ,  but he has made some undeniably important films . Kids ,  Bully ,  and to a lesser extent Ken Park all achieve their intended purpose :  shock ,  revulsion ,  and even disgust . These films are uncompromising in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth . Kids exposed us to the proliferation of A.I.D.S . and sexual promiscuity among the young . Bully touched upon similar issues . Ken Park dealt somewhat ham-handedly with sexual abuse and suburban ennui . Irrefutably ,  all of these films exposed something horrifying and left a bad taste in your mouth .  Wassup Rockers is about a group of poor Hispanic skateboarders from South-Central Las Angeles who go to arbitrarily go to Beverly Hills to skate . That's it .  Wassup Rockers is nothing .  It has no substance . It has an essentially nonexistent narrative . And ,  like Kids ,  it features a cast of first-time actors who were drawn out of the films setting . However ,  unlike Kids ,  none of them have any semblance of talent . There is better acting in porn . This film features ,  without a doubt ,  the most terrible performances I've ever seen in a feature film . One can respect Larry Clark to exposing these young men to the film-making process ,  but these kids are absolutely cringe-worthy ,  folks . Might I add that apparently these gents also produced the soundtrack ,  which features some of the most dismally inept garage punk you'll ever hear- my advice is to pop a couple of migraine pills before you enter the theater ,  or you'll regret it afterward .  But then again ,  it's not like they had much of a script to work with . Every line that is uttered is a contrived ,  pathetically-delivered ,  and irritating beyond all measure . The story itself is ludicrous . It starts out reasonably enough ,  but soon slips quite unexpectedly into sheer absurdity . This begins of course with a capricious sexcapade with a pair of rich white girls ,  followed by a series of clichéd National Lampoonish encounters ,  characters being killed off for no reason ,  and finally resulting in a ridiculous anti-climax . Shots go on much longer than they need to . Be prepared to watch people fall of skateboards for about fifteen minutes straight ,  overlong ,  lingering shots of characters doing nothing or skateboarding down streets . But then again ,  with the script at a scant 32 pages they need as much useless filler as possible . Perhaps Wassup Rockers would have worked better as a short film .  Anyways ,  I could go on like this . This is the worst film Larry Clark has made yet . For those of you who are interested in seeing a Clark movie if only for his shocking pederast antics ,  look elsewhere . This is by far the tamest film he's made yet ,  and it's also the worst . It's flat out horrible . Like ,  Uwe Boll horrible . Definitely the worst one I saw at the festival .  1 / 10
__label__2	I've never been a big Larry Clark fan ,  but somehow ,  I've been dragged to almost every single one of his movies . Now ,  I like independent films ,  and I grew up very much into punk rock ,  and I'd like to say that this film is disappointing to both audiences . Not every punk song incorporates  " Oi !  "  into its choruses ,  as they do in this particular film .  But the real problem with this film is that it switches moods every fifteen minutes or so and lacks any kind of cohesion . Clark has made his living pretending that his fictionalized stories are  " how kids really are ,  "  and as such ,  you'll allow him ten minute scenes of stupid dialog that go nowhere ,  because that's the cinema verite feel he's going for . However ,  when he shoots a ridiculous death scene  ( pick any of them ,  save for the opening drive-by )  ,  the over-stylized attempts at what I assume is intended to be black humor are completely out of context ,  ridiculously shot  ( in most cases ,  far worse than a student film )  and absolutely ludicrous in terms of the story . John Cassavettes and  " Date Movie "  make poor bedfellows ,  as the forays into the latter style take you out of any kind of reality to remind you that you're watching a movie - a really ,  really bad one at that.
__label__1	Look ,  don't get me wrong I love independent films but COME ON !  I could barely sit through it without wanting to kill myself . the director had absolutely no talent and he turned something that could have been OK to a F***ing Nightmare . I am a punk enthusiast myself and even the music sucked . the acting was crap .  I am usually a bleeding heart for these low budget films but this one ,  this one didn't even try . Please don't waste your precious time and money . I am sorry to be so harsh but come on !  it dragged on and and on and on . Remember when the kids got into that party with the weird cupcakes and the watermelon martinis ?  how did they just blend in ?  It made me frustrated how they could just go anywhere they wanted and get into trouble and have sex and a  " meaningful conversation "  with whoever they wanted . I know im blathering but my mind is just buzzing with everything I hated about this film.
__label__1	I recently had to watch this for a project in a Sociology class and thought it was absolutely the worst movie I have ever had to sit through . It was like bad a bad cinemax movie with all the  " good bits "  taken out . Bad acting ,  the fake documentary set up ,  nonsensical plot ,  and rudderless direction all combine to make a terrible ,  terrible film .  The female characters are basically only there to be sex objects . Consider this exchange :   " He's hot . "   " He has a girlfriend . "   " Do you have a girlfriend ?  "   " No . "  *girl takes boys hand and leads him behind some bushes . boy comes out and sits next to other boy ,  girl saunters off*  " Did you hit that ?  "   " No ,  I didn't want to take my pants off . "   " You're stupid . "  Another girl shows up when the boys are going to Beverly Hills ,  gets in the trunk with one of the boys ,  and when they get pulled over by a cop ,  you see the car bobbing up and down .  A homosexual pervert ,  a trigger-happy Clint Eastwood look alike ,  and what seems to be a luchador mask all add to the inanity . One of the boys gets caught by a cop ,  no one cares . One of the boys gets shot ,  no one cares .  Someone said the dialogue was mostly improvised ,  and it shows . Just awful . I would never recommend this film to anyone.
__label__1	That's about the only redeeming quality in a movie that otherwise insults the viewer's intelligence by losing track of time ,  plot ,  and reason for being produced .  Plus ,  how that guy with the glasses ever got a gig in Hollywood is beyond me.
__label__1	Ever once in a while I run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad I wonder why movies exist . This is one of them . This is a terrible attempt to parody The Godfather with annoying cartoon sounds ,  and bad dialogue . Eddie Deezen is just plain annoying as Tony ,  an annoying twit who upon his father ,  Don  ( William Hickey )  ' s request ,  takes over the family business . Tony ,  as I said ,  is an annoying little twit . This makes the whole movie a complete mess . The movie is terribly daffy . It's too cartoonish . The main point I'm trying to make is that you can't make a parody of an acclaimed drama like The Godfather with so much cartoonishness . It doesn't work that way . Believe it or not ,  you have to take a parody of a dramatic movie seriously . If you don't take it seriously ,  it will feel too much like a parody . The thing about doing a parody is that you can't seem too much like you're doing a parody . You have to make it seem like you're taking the movie at least a little bit seriously . It also feels like they're just mocking Woody Allen ,  and that's what makes this movie absolutely terrible.
__label__4	If you liked William Hickey in  " Prizzi's Honor "  ,  he resurrects his character ,  as Don Anthony in  " Mob Boss "  . This is a very weak  " Godfather "  satire with few laughs . Stuart Whitman looks perplexed as to what he's doing in this schlock-fest ?  Morgan Fairchild's performance is one of the better efforts in the movie ,  and that alone is not a good sign for sure . Eddie Deezen vacillates between  " Three Stooges "  slapstick and a bad Woody Allen imitation . Fatally flawed ,   " Mob Boss "  is so derivative that boredom quickly overcomes comedy and the film drags on with car chases ,  hidden weapons in a restaurant bathroom ,  and numerous other nonsense . - MERK
__label__2	This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life . I can't believe people actually a )  write scripts like this b )  have a budget to make a film c )  actually expect it to be successful . Words can't even describe how horrible this film is . I enjoy my fair share of teen movies ,  but this didn't even come close to being funny . In fact ,  it was funny for the sole reason that it was so horrible . I can probably count one  ( maybe two )  parts in the film where I even managed to squeeze out a chuckle  ( other than the laughs regarding how bad it was )  .  Renting this was one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made . Its been a day since I've seen the film ,  and I'm still in shock regarding how horrible it was . Avoid at all costs .  2 / 10
__label__1	I could crap a better movie . This is a waste of time and money . it makes me sick that movies like these are actually getting made and the people making them actually think they're good . I happen to like teen comedies ,  when they're done well . This movie ,  however ,  takes this genre to a new low . With movies like this ,  people think it's actually okay to make this filth and ask unsuspecting people to pay money to sit through it . It's sadism.
__label__1	My mom brought me this movie on a DVD . A guy in a rental recommended it . But in fact ,  this might be the worst movie I've ever seen . You know ,  I didn't expect much from this film ,  but it didn't have a good story ,  it wasn't even funny and it was senseless . I was looking forward to see Christine Lakin in this movie because I loved Step by step . Even she was a huge disappointment . The story was completely unreal . One of the party guys is dead  ( he wasn't dead in fact ,  he woke up later )  ,  the house looks like there exploded a bomb and there are 2 guys who have 3 hours to handle everything . But then there comes a homosexual ,  policeman ... There is a total mess till the end and the guys managed to tide up and everything in like 15 minutes ?  ?  ?  Come on ,  just be realistic at least . Waste of money . Really...
__label__1	Everyone's already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were obviously from people who either had a stake in the film or had friends / family who had a stake in the film ,  and that's okay - if I'd made a movie ,  all of my family and friends would be in there complimenting it ,  too . In all honesty ,  there are some good things along with the bad things in this movie . Unfortunately ,  the bad things far outweigh the good . Good :  The overall plot was mildly interesting . The music was overall pretty good . Several of the songs  ( when you could hear them )  were actually pretty cool . The only musical issues I had were :   # 1 )  the first suspense scene with some sort of quiet instrumental  ( it really seemed to take away from the suspense )  ,   # 2 )  the song being played when the lead characters went to an outdoor party at a friend's house and  # 3 )  the songs that were good were too quiet ,  especially when a heavy metal song was playing in the background while Danny Trejo hung a man  ( sounded like a pretty cool song ,  but it should have ripped out across the scene when Danny Trejo got froggy )  . Now for the completely bad stuff :  The script was atrocious . I mean ,  HORRIBLE . I've seen smoother dialogue in a Star Wars movie . Advice to the writer from a part-time writer and full-time movie buff :  When you write dialogue ,  ask yourself ,   " Is this something that people would actually say ?  "  Honestly ,  the script was laughable . I want to slam the acting ,  but with that kind of writing ,  it's hard to know if they have talent or not . The mildly interesting plot was seriously hampered by the crappy dialogue . I know it was low-budget ,  but words don't cost money - if you have a good script ,  even semi-competent actors can pull it off . This movie didn't seem to have either ,  but hopefully the director will get a second shot at making a better film.
__label__1	This movie was terrible not only was the plot weak ,  but the acting was unbelievable bad ,  and at times pathetic . Very unrealistic dialogs people in real life don't talk like this and there is no emotion or feeling in anything said very monotone except for the almost indistinguishable whispering that constantly occurs . Even the editing is bad the cuts are terrible . The camera work was sloppy and shaky on close ups even sways back and forth during conversations . There is nothing positive about this movie and George Katts needs to be working on heavy machinery or anything where he doesn't have to converse with other humans because he clearly doesn't know how to . How did this movie win /  get nominated for awards oh my god !  ! 
__label__1	Wow ,  this movie really sucked down below the normal scale of dull ,  boring ,  and unimaginative films I've seen recently . The acting was poor and robotic . The story was so bland you could have summed it up with a simple 5-minute short . Audio was so poor and dirty it was hard to even listen to ;  perhaps it was unedited from the camera it was shot off of ?  I'm not sure which movie the 3 glowing reviewers were commenting on ,  but it wasn't this one . Perhaps the director had his hand in seeing that his film received a good review ,  at least before the real reviews started to show up .  Save your time or you'll just be wasting your time and money on this film . Absolute suckage ! 
__label__4	Don't get fooled by the  ' awards ' and the comment below . This is just 1 poor movie . The way George Katt played his character  ( the soft gangster )  makes it very annoying to watch . The conversation in the opening scene is a dramatic display of this . De in the rest of the film the character's head seems to be somewhere else . His emotions don't match with the things that happen in the film.The things he says as a voice-over doesn't add anything to the film . It just makes Zeus an even more spineless character with is head in the clouds .  The story and the film was put together with a total lack of fantasy . All parts of the film were poorly stolen from other modern directors . Let's hope Jon Rosten will use his own style and ideas for his future films.
__label__2	This was pretty bad - from bad acting ,  bad technical details ,  bad camera shots ,  and bad audio  ( even though I was watching a DVD ,  sometimes I couldn't hear what they were saying ,  sometimes it was blowing my speakers ,  even within the same conversation )  . The plot was predictable ,  and the characters consisted of mostly unbelievable neurotics ,  bi-polars ,  and caricatures . Character development was awful ... the bratty little sister  ( why was she even written into the script ?  )  ,  the nagging mom  ( again - what purpose ?  )  the whiny girlfriend  ( why didn't he dump her long ago ?  )  ,  the  ' dark suits ' gang  ( how original - couldn't think of a better name I guess )  ,  the drug dealer's hot girlfriend  ( gotta have a hot Latina if your going to have LA gangs I guess ,  but really ... )  ,  etc etc Can't believe I watched the whole thing.
__label__2	Return to Sender ,  a.k.a . Convicted ,  is almost imperfect . The one good thing about this particular film was that I was never bored . That being said ,  the reviews that hail this movie as a low-budget success may not have watched the same movie that I saw .  Rather than write a review and tell you what happens and what works and doesn't work ,  I will simply comment that nothing works . There are plot holes in this movie that you can drive a semi through . The acting in the film is not very good ,  although that may be a result of a script so poorly worded that it could have been ghost written by George Lucas . There was no need for exceptional sets or costumes for this particular movie and everything seemed appropriate . Did I mention that there were some plot holes ?  By the end of the movie ,  you are wondering how a blind guy can be such a good shot with a shotgun ,  why Kelly Preston trusts Aidan Quinn ,  why she would fall asleep the night before her client is supposed to be killed ,  how Aidan Quinn can drive 400 miles in such a short time with a car that keeps breaking down during the rest of the movie ,  why Aidan Quinn didn't by a fifth instead of a bunch of nips ,  etc .  With all that being said ,  this is certainly a B-movie ,  and a terrible one at that . The unfortunate thing is that it just isn't bad enough to be good . If you value your time ,  please let this serve as a public service message to stay away from this one.
__label__3	Slow-moving ponderous movie with terrible acting on the whole - but lovely locations  &  clothes to admire ,  and ,  of course ,  Timothy Dalton ,  who does a compelling job ,  as always . I wanted to laugh out loud at the voice-overs - so silly !  !  But Dalton is always worth watching ,  even in bad movies ,  a wonderful actor ,  older now ,  but still very handsome and masculine . This movie is worth viewing only to see him....and he seems like he wandered into a bad dime romance novel ,  poor fellow . Your time would be better spent watching Mr . Dalton in 1970's  " Wuthering Heights "  or the early 1980's BBC version of  " Jane Eyre "  . Poor Sela Ward ,  so lovely ,  but so wooden ... surely she's been better in other movies.
__label__3	This is an adaptation of an Edith Wharton work ,  whose writing is amazing . Sadly ,  this movie never shakes the feeling that these 20th century movie people don't grasp the 19th century repression and desperation Wharton's work depicts . Ward and Dalton aren't so bad ,  but Alicia Witt's wooden performance made me wince . She was supposed to be playing the restless element of the story ,  but she stood like a stick the whole movie long ,  and I never believed a word out of her mouth . When she asks Sela Ward  " Why can't I move you ?  "  near the end of the film ,  I couldn't help but answer :   " That's what I've been wondering for the last hour and a half !  !  !  " 
__label__3	The first Shiloh film was enjoyable by adults as well as children . This one starts with about an hour of filler where not much happens ,  with stilted dialogue ;  only in the last act is there any significant action that really moves the plot along . The dog is still cute ,  though ,  and young kids may enjoy it.
__label__2	Jane Russell was an underrated comedienne and singer  ( see SON OF PALEFACE and GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES )  ,  but you'd never guess it from her display here . A real stinker ,  produced by Howard Hughes in his all-too-successful effort to kill off RKO Radio Pictures .  The movie kills its first opportunity to show off sexy Jane when it places her in a bubble bath and then has her chastely singing  " I'll Be Switched  ( If I Ain't Gettin ' Hitched )  " --and it's all downhill from there . In her autobiography ,  Russell apologized for the movie's number  " Lookin ' for Trouble "  because it was supposedly so risque--nowadays you could show it on The Disney Channel .  ( By the way ,  said autobiography has a jaw-dropping photo of Russell in a bikini ,  far sexier than anything
__label__1	This film has recently been televised by Turner Classic Movies . It may have been considered racy in its time ,  and may have made money ,  but even the most die-hard Jane Russell fan will find it hard to sit through this dreck .  There are many movie musicals from the 1950s which can withstand the test of time ,  even though dated by current standards ,  but which can still be enjoyed because of good music or dancing or an amusing plot .  " The French Line "  ,  however ,  fails at all of these aspects .  It doesn't matter that Russell was a fine singer when she is given lousy vocal material . The entire cast is dragged down by a boring ,  trite plot and dialogue .  It's not even worth recording and skipping through to only the musical numbers--they're crummy.
__label__2	I wish they would just make a special section in the video rental stores for movies like this . The section would read :   " Movies for lonely older men who like to watch young girls being naughty and wearing fetish clothes "  I guess dominique swain ,  after lolita nd now this ,  is establishing herself as the queen of the dirty old man genre.
__label__1	I'm not even going to waste more time describing how bad this movie is . Bottom line :  It was horribly acted ,  had enormous plot holes and went absolutely NOWHERE . The only good thing about it was the description my digital cable gave for the movie :   " A married man with a struggling business has a fling with his secretary . "  Huh ?  ?  Wrong movie apparently ,  although it may have made things slightly more interesting if any of the description were true .  --Shelly
__label__3	 " Tart "  is a pathetic attempt at film making which wanders around and among a bunch of Manhattan teens exploring all the usual teen preppie stuff...sex ,  drugs ,  and classical music almost completely without story ,  focus ,  or purpose . Griffith is in the film for about 2 minutes while Swain dutifully works her way through another in her long list of dog flicks . Nothing in this films works and Wayne should consider getting a real job . Not recommended for anyone . PU !  Ugh !   ( D ) 
__label__1	Why do people make bad movies ?  Didn't anyone working on the picture know that what they were making had no point ?  There is something about this picture that threw me off ,  besides the fact that I found this  " movie "  to be unrealistic ,  pathetic ,  and POORLY ACTED . I admire them for the try ,  but the  " actors "  in the movie at times seem to be trying to hard and no single character has substance or says anything mildly intelligent . This movie deserves zero stars . But I did not have that option ,  so it gets a 1.
__label__1	It was so disjointed - it seemed to jump from place to place - and the  " thief "  was obvious . It was a poor man's  ( not to mention high school )   " Less than Zero "  . I would pass on this movie as it has very little to add . So many issues are left unresolved ,  and that's okay - but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you wonder what's exactly going on is terrible . The voice-over is needed because the movie doesn't work on its own . Avoid this movie ,  and watch something else about rich teen angst . I'm sure there are plenty of others to watch . Don't waste your time on this.
__label__2	SPOILERS !   I gave this film 2 out of 10 for 2 scenes that I will never forget.....by the way ,  my husband rented this surprising non-blow  ' em up almost chick looking flick...but I guessed why when I saw the cover....girls in school uniforms....duh....lol....ah well ,  men if ya can't beat  ' em join  ' em ... ; - )   Bijou Philips ,  one of my favorites on the indie screen...too cute......not only gets into bestiality  ( her toy dog is the best lesbian in town according to her bubbly outrageous character ) ..that would be the first worthwhile scene ...  Then she enters a restroom in a lovely gown  &  goes into a stall....after a bit she gets up ,  goes out to the party she  &  the pathetically sad  ' Cat ' character are at ,  &  hands a shiny silver ice bucket to the host of the party...the host looks in her precious silver ice bucket and says ,   " oh my god it's poo . "   I love Bijou Phillips myself for her creativity and unusual movie choices ,  this would definitely be one of them....and um ,  I would rent it for the poo scene if I were you.....I am not a big poo jokes fan ,  but it definitely puts the  ' party people ' in their place  ( they didn't look like they were having a good time anyway.....lol ) ...You will never forget these two scenes...hmm ,  but is that what we want in our databanks ? ....Maybe you shouldn't follow my advice at all....lol  Dominique Swain is kind of squirrelly  &  sad in her confusing nonsensical role in  ' Tart' . I don't know ,  I can't decide if I like her because she is so into indie films ?  ?  Indie films are awesome  &  all but couldn't she pick a few good ones ?  I am going to check out a few more of her movies and reserve judgment ... but this one was ,   ( pardon the reference to beasts )  a dog.....
__label__1	For the first time in reviewing films ,  I found myself immediately uninterested in this story . I don't know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story behind the characters ,  but it felt bland ,  overused ,  and completely unoriginal . Within the first thirty minutes ,  I found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story . I felt as if I had seen this structure before ,  and Tart was providing nothing new to surprise me . After thinking that it may just be my mood ,  I stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning ,  but the same feeling persisted . I just didn't care . That is not a good sign . The characters were bland . When I say bland ,  I literally mean that by watching them develop ,  you will never have any flavor hit your palate . The story seemed recycled ,  nearly to the point of plagiarism . Now ,  I am not saying that Christina Wayne stole this story ,  but she added nothing fresh to the perspective . The casting was horrid ,  the underlying symbolism and themes were so far lost that no critic could find them  ( nor the characters )  ,  and the stories were vague and sloppy . You knew nothing about anyone or anything ,  and instead of pushing more emphasis on the characters ,  we instead found ourselves with drugs ,  minor sex ,  and money pushed into our faces . These are themes we have seen in every film since the dawn of film time ,  yet somehow could not be creatively captured by Wayne .  What immediately pulled me away from this story ?  It was mainly the characters . I have seen most of Brad Renfro's work ,  and honestly he needs to redefine himself . Director Larry Clark has defined him ,  and oddly he cannot get out of that stereotypical character . Within the first twenty minutes of Renfro's screen time I was bored . I knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why . It was spectacular nor impressive ,  just repetitive . He needed to bring some excitement or suspense to his role ,  instead of just blandly playing this random socialite . Without a strong character ,  the final climax of this film comes instead as a letdown . Renfro did not showcase the best of his abilities in this film . While I am on the subject  nobody showcased the best of their abilities . What is going on with Dominique Swain ,  outside of Lolita ,  I don't believe she has really emerged as an actress ,  and following-up with roles such as Cat Storm doesn't help . Bijou Phillips was the only actress that I witnessed actually try to bring something remarkable to the screen ,  sadly due to everyone else's horrid acting ,  she was lost . Rambling here and there ,  and honestly nearly forgotten about during the second act . Melanie Griffith was a pointless cast and most of this film's budget probably went to her TWO scenes that she was in . Maybe the rest of it went to the random guy from The Kids in the Hall ,  who desperately needs to place himself far away from this project .  My biggest problem ,  outside of the acting ,  was the pacing of this film . Nothing ,  and this is hard for me to say ,  but nothing gelled together . There were so many sub-stories happening throughout the course of the film that no actual substance was formed . The robberies ,  the teenage  " angst and woe "  ,  the wealthy socialites learning how horrible real life is ,  the random Kids in the Hall guy ,  and even the ending just felt rushed and horribly edited together . With this shoddy craftsmanship the whole story never really formed any true shape . Family structures were never defined ,  characters were never given any emotion ,  and all we are left with are bits and pieces of honest leftovers . Wayne did not complete the task at hand .  While I hate to put the entire burden on the director ,  with this film I am left with little choice . With a horrid title that just screamed the complete opposite of what this film was about ,  with amateurish directional ability the cast pretty much was able to give every emotion in every scenes ,  leaving us with disgusting acting and poor developments ,  and with vague storytelling it is hard to place any  " good "  behind Tart . This was a film I had heard nothing about ,  and after viewing it I can see why . All Wayne has done with this film is random take excerpts from other films that have done a better job of defining all the elements above and cut all together to make the film Tart . It is hard for me to say this ,  but Wayne ruined this film . While I don't believe there was much to fully take from the story ,  any remaining elements of excitement were drained as Wayne took the helm . While most of the time you can credit some of the story ,  perhaps strong acting ,  or even the music ,  in Tart you can credit nothing . From the opening sequence until the end ,  I felt like I was swimming through very lumpy oatmeal . No consistency ,  no strength .  Overall ,  this film is a waste of your time . If you are searching for some deep symbolic elements or possibly some banter on our society ,  you will not find it in this film . While I know that was what Wayne was attempting to show ,  the final product seems like it was edited on an Etch-a-Sketch . It was an embarrassing film to sit through ,  and encourage nobody to pick it up . Wayne threw to the wind all the teachings of her Columbia University education and destroyed two hours of my life . Avoid at all costs !    Grade :  * out of *****
__label__1	As a rule ,  I try to find as much in films as I possibly can to enjoy them . I made no exceptions with  " Tart "  ,  doing my very best to appreciate it for what it was . But no effort ,  no matter how great ,  could possibly redeem this pitiful excuse for a movie .  It failed for a number of reasons . Firstly ,  the cinematography was directionless and ineffective . Secondly ,  the script reached depths of  ' poor ' that took it well and truly beyond the  ' so bad it's good ' category . Thirdly ,  the acting left mind-blowing amounts to be desired - it was appalling ,  it really was . Anyone who saw Mischa Barton  ( seen here as the remarkably terrible Grace ,  a character so poorly invented and realised that Ja Ja Binks doesn't seem so bad )  as Devon in John Duigan's  " Lawn Dogs "  will wonder what went wrong between then and now . Perhaps ,  had she been given a character worth bothering with ,  and a modicum of direction ,  she at least might have given this film ONE redeeming feature . Alas ,  such was not the case . Finally ,  the film seemed to have no point whatsoever ,  expressing nothing ,  achieving nothing . Really ,  I wonder why Christina Wayne bothered .   " Tart "  made a feeble attempt to be something ,  and failed . The result - a film ,  sadly ,  so bad that it's just very ,  very bad . Don't bother - it really isn't worth it.
__label__1	I only wish that I had the good sense to turn this movie off in the beginning when I knew it was terrible .   Instead I gave it the benefit of the doubt and waited for it to get better .   Don't make the same mistake I did .   The title has nothing to do with the movie . The movie has nothing to do with the real world . The plot has nothing to do with a plot . The acting consists of a guy who wants to be John Cusack ,  but can't pull it off . The lead is a girl who tries to be Claire Daines . Sadly ,  she can't pull that off either . They are in love ,  although god only knows why . And by the end I was hoping that they would all kill each other off just so I could believe none of these kids would ever taint the world again.
__label__1	Just once in a while you see a movie so mind-numbingly awful that you have to comment on it . This was that movie . Poorly scripted ,  acted and totally unbelievable . It's movies like these that show you how good the banal Hollywood trash usually is ! 
__label__2	The box to this movie totally misrepresents itself . The cover shows a view of legs  &  panties in a short skirt . The title is `Tart . ' The synopsis on the back of the box made it seem as though Cat ,  the main character ,  was an outcast who became one of the popular students ,  but that popularity lead to a bizarre lifestyle that she could not escape from . Everything that the box built this movie up to was a horrible lie . I expected a sort of crappy ,  direct-to-video version of `Heathers ' targeted at the teenagers of today .  Let me tell you what `Tart ' was really about . Yes ,  this really is the plot ;  so if you don't want to know what happens ,  stop reading . We have one unlikable ,  boring rich girl . This unlikable girl's best friend is a skank . The skank gets expelled from school ,  so the unlikable girl befriends some British girl . This leads to the unlikable girl dating this boring guy ,  who the box refers to as the `most popular boy in school . ' If that guy was the most popular guy in their school ,  I wish I would have gone to that high school ,  because I could have kicked the crap out of him . Anyway ,  as any movie will tell you ,  the most popular guy in school is invariably a murderer or drug addict or thief ,  or in this case ,  all of the above . Anyway ,  everyone ends up disliking the unlikable main character because she is Jewish . Then the most popular guy in school beats her best friend ,  the skank ,  to death with a rock because the skank caught the most popular boy in a homosexual act . The unlikable girl's stoic mother and hypochondriac younger brother are there for her at the end . Oh ,  and the entire movie is about snotty rich kids and their horrible parents too . Gee ,  what is wrong with that ?  That sounds like a fantastic movie !  Well ,  that's what I thought . But you see ,  there are NO likeable characters in this movie . The main character is boring . The filmmakers made her average ,  while during the film she keeps spouting off about what a freak she is . The skank is not skanky enough ,  and has little screen time . The popular guy is nothing to write home about . The popular girls are just your run-of-the-mill rich girls . There are no moral lessons . Cat ,  the boring main character ,  is not a freak ,  does not ever become one of the truly popular girls ,  and  ( worst of all )  after all the crap she goes through ,  she thinks she is still too good to befriend the only nice girl ,  the dorky girl . To be honest ,  I have no idea why the movie is called Tart . I kept asking ,  who's the tart ?  Is she the tart ?  Are they all tarts ?  At 94 minutes ,  theoretically this is not a long movie . But after actually watching this awful waste of a VHS tape ,  and not knowing who the tart was ,  I was surprised that the movie was only an hour and a half . The movie felt like it was two hours and some change . After a while ,  I was hoping the movie would be about pop tarts . At least when you look at a box of pop tarts ,  you know what to expect.
__label__4	Movie Title - Tart  Date of review - 5 / 26 / 02  Year of movie - 2001  Stars - Dominique Swain ,  Brad Renfro ,  Bijou Phillips  ( barely )  ,  Melanie Griffith  ( barely )   NeCRo's Rating - 4 skulls out of 10  May Contain spoilers  Plot  An  " outcast "  Dominique Swain wants to be with the  " in "  group and so she abandons her real friends and joins them.......much annoying rich people talk occurs . Acting  ugh ,  I guess I got what I wanted in that Dominique was ok ,  but man ,  the rest of the cast besides maybe Brad Renfro were bad or at least not interesting or likable at all . I know some could say that the others were good because they made me hate them....trust me....I like unlikable chars but this group is unlikable because they can't convincingly be bad people .  It figures that the only other people I got this for were barely even in it and that is Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips ,  but the little time they had they were ok . Melanie spoke maybe 2 lines ,  but at least Bijou had a good character although small .  Violence and Gore  My mind was constantly under attack from horrid dialogue and very very annoying characters ,  that's violence enough !  !  ok there was one bludgeoning with a rock which was ok .  T & A Nudity Factor  hahaha ,  they couldn't even add in any nudity to help spice up this movie ,  probably because no one would want to bear their body for this crap . If they are going to expose themselves they should do it in a movie where they will be remembered as their character and not for  " oh hey I heard she gets naked in this one . "   Overall View of the movie  ( review )   ok ok I know I pride myself on being the person who can like most if not almost all movies or at least find some good in it . Well this movie is one of the few I really struggled to find anything worth while in . The problem with this movie is that it is so damn annoying . I already have a deep hatred for snobby rich people attitudes and that didn't help either . All this movie really is ,  is just a bunch of rich people sitting around acting depressed and stupid . I can't stress the annoyance factor enough . This movie tries to rehash the tried and true  " In group "  plotline which can usually be done ok with little difficulty .  Why do I not have a pic from the movie or the box cover ?  Well I felt this movie didn't deserve that glory so I decided to put a pic of the reason I rented this ,  and that reason is none other than Dominique Swain . Yes I too was wooed by her in Lolita and thought she was so good that I decided from then on to check her out in any movie in which she acts . At least I keep my promises and yes I have seen the majority of her movies ,  minus a few hard to find ones . She herself is a great actress and I would defend her actively ,  but man she chooses some of the crappiest movies to star in . This movie and Smokers are both in the same boat of crappiness ,  but at least Smokers had a cool idea for a story and even some real good scenes .  Also the dvd box tries to fool you into thinking that this movie has stars as well in it by putting Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips names on the front of the box . If there's one thing that P****S me off it's a movie that plasters the names of stars on a box to make you think  " wow it has  _  _  _  _  I wonder how good  _  _  _ is in this one I saw  _  _  _  in that movie and thought she was great !  "  only to have the big names in the movie for a total of maybe 10 minutes between the 2 . Bijou actually had a part that semi-meant something . Melanie on the other hand ,  only has 2 lines about ... Granted I don't like Melanie that much ,  but this is about ethics and not star acting .  Out of all this mess though props must go to Brad Renfro for turning in an ok performance along with Dominique . Brad may be one very messed up kid in real life ,  but at least he can act . So the only reason this movie gets any skulls is because I got what I basically wanted which was Dominique Swain and Brad Renfro . Also I had the added pleasure of seeing underrated actress Bijou Phillips make me like her even more . So even though I was annoyed throughout I still came out with some positives ,  although this was pretty hard this time .  I recommend you to ONLY see this if you've seen Lolita and know how good Dominique is or if you are some offbeat fan of Brad or Bijou . Uber Melanie fans will be sorely depressed . Also if you're a fan of crappy movies like me ,  please do not assume this be a guilty pleasure because you will feel guilty alright ,  for the money spent on buying or renting .  Some movies are  " so bad that they are good "  as the saying goes . What they forgot to add was  " so bad that they are good  ( to pass up )  . "   NeCRo
__label__2	TART is the worst movie I've seen this year ,  and that includes both the Affleck / J.Lo bomb GIGLI and the Rob Zombie borefest HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES . I don't know if that's a fair comparison seeing that TART was made two years earlier and probably has a budget half that of even the low-budget 1000 CORPSES . Regardless ,  all three movies suffer from the same shortcomings :  horrible script ,  horrible acting ,  horrible direction .  *** SPOILERS ***  ( although I honestly don't think there's anything to spoil )   TART is about a group of super-spoiled private school kids . Most of them reside in super-sized apartments along New York's hyper-expensive Park Avenue ,  thanks to the finances of their neglectful parents . The film showcases the aimless life of one of the students  ( Cat )  as she discards her only true friend  ( as frivolous a person as she was )  in the pursuit of the  " good life "  with the in-crowd . That ,  of course ,  leads to sex ,  drugs ,  and music that is substantially worse than rock  &  roll . Everything is overly dramaticized in the way that truly bad movies usually are . Cat's first sexual experience leads to her being branded a tramp and ostracized by her newly acquired circle of friends ;  her first encounter with drugs leads to her nearly being dumped down a garbage chute after her cohorts believe her to be dead from an overdose . No heavy-handed messages there ,  he said sarcastically .  That's mainly what the  " seen it before 100 times "  plot entails . Other minor ,  and even less interesting ,  plot details include one friend who steals jewelry and trinkets from all the others ,  a wild child who lives life on the edge  ( and finally falls off of it one night in the EAST Hamptons )  ,  an anti-Semitic British chick who ends her close friendship with Cat the moment she finds out Cat has a Jewish father ,  and Cat's strained relationship with her single mother who tries unsuccessfully to get Cat to appreciate the privileged life she has . The thief turns out to be an irredeemable lowlife . The  " wild child "  is played as a toned down version of one of the Hilton sisters . The British girl disappears from the film after the break-up . The mother / daughter relationship is seen as totally inconsequential until the film's final schmaltzy scene ,  where she and her beleaguered mother have a reconciliation of sorts . *yawn*  *** END SPOILERS ***  About the cast and crew ... Dominique Swain came on the scene strong with her role as the underaged seductress in 1997's highly watchable LOLITA and FACE / OFF . Her performances were strong enough to land her on quite a few  " ones-to-watch "  lists at the time . She was 17 at the time and I hope that they will not be the best roles of her career . If she takes a few more roles like the one she takes in TART ,  it very well may be .  I've only seen Bijou Phillips in one other film  ( BULLY )  and I swear her performance in that one was nearly identical to the one she gave here . I'm not sure if she's incapable of giving varied performances or if it was just a coincidence her roles in the two were so very similar . My guess is that the former is true . I sense this woman possesses very little talent as far as acting is concerned . Here ,  she is the actress tapped to portray the watered-down Hilton sister . That she gives such a weak performance is amazing considering that she grew up with ,  and remains friends with ,  the real-life Hilton sisters . She's essentially playing a version of herself in this film ,  and doing a damn poor job of it .  As for writer / director Christina Wayne ... I know nothing of her other than TART was her first ,  and only ,  film project to date . With a first effort like this it is no wonder her career in show business was short-lived.
__label__1	Eghads ,  what a bad movie . Tart is perhaps the very worst movie I've seen all year ,  and I've run across some doozies . There is nothing redeeming about this trash ,  from the characterization to the direction to the plot . Even the usually brilliant Dominique Swain couldn't save this movie . None of the characters are in the least bit sympathetic ,  with the possible exception of Eloise  ( wonderfully portrayed by Lacey Chabert ,  the only bright spot in this dismal failure )  .  *******Possible Spoilers********  The main problem with Tart is that it rambles on without saying anything . It staggers about drunkenly instead of leading us along the path of the story . It also introduces numerous potentially tantalizing details  ( the hypochondriac brother ,  the mother's possessions constantly being repossessed ,  the anti-semitic classmate ,  the other classmate's murderous father )  without successfully exploring a single one of them . And just when I finally thought that there might be some sort of resolution for the characters ,  the movie crashes to an unexpectedly violent end .  I left the movie feeling that it was trying to tell me something ,  but with the strong impression that the message was forgotten before it could be communicated . This is an obvious first film from a writer / director who really needs to spend much more time working under more established film makers before foisting any more of her work on an unsuspecting public .  I gave this film 1 out of 10 ,  and I'm usually very generous ,  even with bad films.
__label__1	Basic structure of a story :  Beginning ,  Middle ,  End .  Sometimes this structure is played with ,  and we get Memento or Irreversible and the story plays backwards . Sometimes it's just not linear ,  a la Pulp Fiction . Regardless ,  they all have a beginning ,  middle and end .  This is the first film I have ever seen that doesn't have an end .  Beginning :  Girl's best friend is expelled .  Middle :  Girl needs to cope without best friend .  End :  Non existent .  Not that having an end would've saved this film ,  but at least it would have been complete .  It's an exercise in apathy ;  we get a party-mix of characters ,  and they all turn out to be duds . Boring ,  vain ,  vapid and pallid imitations of people .  And here's the action within this film :  NOTHING HAPPENS . Nothing at all happens . Mischa Barton tries to talk with a plummy English accent ,  Dominique Swain whines a lot and Brad Renfro receives a blow job from some old guy . End of movie .  By the time the credits rolled ,  I had a horrible feeling that many prisoners must feel :  periods of time ,  those precious minutes of our life ,  have just been wasted .  The only passable point  ( and that is a very emphatic ONLY )  is Brad Renfro . He acts well . Lacey Chabert I tend to like ,  but no luck here . Due to good work in other films ,  I will forgive Mischa Barton this travesty ,  but I hope all cast members were slapped in the face for their involvement .  Please ,  I implore you . Avoid . Don't fool yourself into thinking  " I'll make up my own mind "  . My sister told me to never see this ,  and I ignored her ,  wanting to make up my own mind . That was a bad decision .  I have never hated a film . There are many I don't like ,  but I have never hated a film . Until I saw this.
__label__3	The beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest of it was predictable . It was just one of those movies that I came across in my netflix instant queue and I thought it would be interesting to see Brad Renfro and Bijou Phillips team up together again since Bully . Unfortunately  " interesting "  never happened in this movie . Swain plays an invisible girl at a private school whose best friend is rich and does anything she wants at any time  ( Phillips )  . But Swain likes one of the boys  ( Renfro )  from the  " in crowd "  and eventually starts hanging with them . And ,  of course ,  like all other movies things are good  ( or so you assume since the movie never hints on that things are good )  and then things become not so good by hanging with the rich kids .  The problem with the movie is that there are absolutely no peaks and valleys . It is just a dead lifeless movie that after you've watched it ,  you feel you could have done anything better . Some scenes  ( the ones with Renfro's parents )  don't even make sense as to being in the movie because the director and writer didn't follow up on it ,  at all .  All the interesting things that COULD have played out was just completely ignore and this is almost like watching a before they were stars episode  ( Mischa Barton and Rachel Bison from the OC )  .   The only shining light in this movie ,  and the reason it doesn't get a ONE rating from me is Phillips . They needed more scenes with her in it . Renfro just look like he brought over a bit of his character from Bully . And ,  for pete's sake ,  the Title is BS ,  change the name.
__label__3	 " Tart "  is a good illustration of old the Yogi Berra saying :   " If you don't know where you are going ,  you will probably end up someplace else "  . Writer / Director Christina Waye  ( in her first feature )  has managed to make a  $ 3 Million movie that ends up someplace else .  " Tart "  is either a coming of age story devoid of characters that a rational person can connect with ,  a black comedy without any humor ,  or a sexploitation movie without anything that is particularly sexy .  Unlike the standard Swain film ,   " Tart "  actually employed a competent and experienced production designer . Good enough to provide two extremely nice shots :  the scene of Swain and Barton taking a bubble bath together and the scene of Swain in the park-featuring a nice montage of the  " Alice in Wonderland "  sculpture . The symbolism incorporated into these elements supports the possibility that Waye  ( despite the absence of a linear logic or unity of tone )  actually has some visionary talent and aspirations for making a quality film .   It is even possible that Waye was trying for a fusion of the somewhat expressionistic  " Metropolitan "  and the camp classic  " Cruel Intentions "  which also deal with the Manhattan upper class . There are many camera shots framed by windows and doors yet few tight shots of faces and eyes . The former technique hinting at symbolism and the latter at intentional distancing from the characters and their motivations .  " Tart "  seemed on the verge of veering into camp territory at least twice and would have been well advised to keep going in that direction . First there was the scene where they try to dump the seemingly deceased Swain into the garbage chute . Then there is the whole bit about her father being Jewish  ( played to the same extreme as Joel Grey dancing with the Jewish guerrilla in  " Cabaret "  )  .   In her other films Swain's acting technique is to overwhelm each scene in which she appears  ( insert scenery chewing here )  but in  " Tart "  she actually shows an ability to restrain herself . This is the best performance of her career . It also provides some clues about her physical deterioration from willowy super cute in  " Girl "  to hulking lumpy-faced in  " Pumpkin "  . This transformation was about half-complete by the time she made  " Tart "  ;  so go the ravages of time .   Mischa Barton  (  " Sixth Sense's "  I feel better girl )  and Lacey Chabet are excellent in supporting roles . The rest of the cast is simply horrible ,  although some of the blame for this should go to Waye's script and direction.
__label__1	Though I have watched Salò ,  I do not know if excrement tastes tart . If it does ,  this  " film "  is accurately titled . So much of roughage ,  so little substance ,  this is the celluloid equivalent of celery - only it does not cleanse the palate . It leaves the taste of wasted time in the mind's mouth ,  and if I could vomit this film and get back that expanse / expense I would . Detention was more exciting . The director should be forced to wear a dunce cap ,  and the Spirit of Ed Wood Jr . couldn't save this semi-professional projection from certain failure . A waste of time ,  a waste of mind . **Don't be fooled by the toothsome Dominique Swain :  competent eye-candy she was in the Lolita remake ,  less tragic and savvier than Sue Lyon ,  though by no means better . However ,  a previously competent turn of the screw does not make her a skilled crafts-person . You need craft for that ,  not crap ,  which is what this film is . The reels belong in the girls ' bathroom ,  flushed till the pipes burst ,  while director / direct-less Christina Wayne should do 5-10 in study hall . Watch anything else and pass this class ,  by  ( bye )  ,  forever ! 
__label__3	At least for me . I have been following the career of Mr . Almdovar since the beginning and I was not crazy about this film . I think Penelope Cruz was miscast ,  the type of woman she is portraying does not look that good ,  she makes the character unbelievable . Also ,  the singing scene was just weird . I do not get the point and the lip-sync was awful .  As Spaniard ,  another thing that drove me nuts are the accents . Why people coming from the same place have such a different accent ?  The difference between the two sisters is notable and makes no sense . And the village ?  are we in 2007 or 1950 ?  I found myself trying to explain to my American husband that many of the things in the movie are  " old school "  ,  things are not like that anymore .  I was expecting more but this time Mr.Almodovar did not deliver ,  at least for me . I am not saying that Miss Cruz does a bad job ,  I am saying that she does not belong there ,  not portraying that character.
__label__4	One of the first things I noticed that allowed this culture to stand out among the rest was during the wake at Sole's place . An aerial shot is used to show Sole being flowered with kisses by a sea of women . I believed this was a commentary on the closeness that women had for each other of this cultureones who stuck together across the generations ,  separations and misunderstandings ,  and still being able to bond and rely on each other . Also ,  the film seemed to glorify women as almost flawless individuals . What I mean by flawless is that they did not suffer the consequences for their actions and were treated as if they had no imperfections . An example of this is shortly after Paula accidentally killed her father . Her mother immediately comes to her rescue and takes full responsibility for the act while Paula seems to suffer almost no remorse for what she has done . Again ,  another example of this is when each daughter  ( or granddaughter )  has had an opportunity to reunite with their supposed  " dead "  mother  ( grandmother )  . Knowing the stresses that this has most likely caused in their family ,  each one of them still embraces the mother without care for what she has donethat is ,  killing her husband and his lover . In this light ,  women are portrayed as ones who not only love each other independent of character acts ,  but also ones who don't seem bothered in the least by the acts in which their friends / family members perform .  Another idea that I thought was intriguing of this culture was in regards to their idea of the supernatural . With the death of Raimunda and Sole's mother and her inexplicable return ,  the director builds the audience's emotions to believe that this film is going to embody the supernatural . The people depicted in this culture seem very supernatural ,  that is to say ,  very eager to believe that life exists beyond the grave . Their aunt ,  long-time friend Augustina ,  the prostitute and other people living in the city of La Mancha all believe the rumors of the dead coming back to family members to finish the  " unfinished business . "  I believed this was a mixed reflection of the culture's religious faith  ( predominantly Catholic )  as well as their need to make amends with those who had no chance to be forgiven during mortality . The belief they held in regards to the dead being  " alive "  was also to give hope to the destitute circumstances they suffered in mortality . When the viewer is exposed to the fact that this film isn't supernatural at all ,  it's interesting to observe the role the mother continues to play . She's treated as if she still is a ghost  ( i.e . hiding in small crevices  ( underneath the bed or inside a car trunk )  )  . I believe the director portrayed the mother this way to heighten the already existent supernatural beliefs the city had adopted . The mother's character seemed to be a metaphor for the city's long-held belief in life after death.
__label__2	A film by Almodovar- sends a tingle down my spine every time . The capitalized print which opens the Spanish auteur's latest feature instantly induces memories of salacious nuns ,  gentle necrophiliacs ,  wisecracking transsexualsand I haven't even got as far as the infant-terrible's critically reviled early work . And after a beautiful opening montage ,  with the camera roving across a wind-swept graveyard animated by a hoard of widows feverishly scrubbing tombstones ,  I thought Pedro had me again under his wicked spell .  Yet once my nostalgia had subsided ,  there was very little to fill its place . For a director who revels in bringing humanity to assassins and rapists ,  he does a very poor job at finding any emotional depth or endearing quality in his women . Penelope Cruz is Raimunda ,  a headstrong housewife whose life is complicated by her daughter's accidental killing of her abusive husband . Thankfully she lives in Almodovar's Spain where your friends will quite happily help to dispose of a corpse for the offer of a round of cocktails . Add to the melting-pot the ghost of Raimunda's mother and a host of other eccentrically warm-hearted matriarchs .  " Volver "  means literally to return ,  and Pedro does appear to be recycling old material . The sub-plot of incest feels as though it were tacked-on as the obligatory  " taboo "  . Instead of commenting on or subverting the issue ,  as with his treatment of paedophilia in Bad Education ,  it feels forced and unconvincing amid the film's chick-flick sentimentality . I suggest Almodovar call his next film Salir  ( to move on ) .
__label__4	I've been surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film . It seemed dull to me ,  much as I enjoyed looking at Penelope Cruz ,  and the plot details often poorly worked out . It also seemed like an intensely sexist film :  if the gender roles were reversed ,  almost everyone with any sense would be up in arms complaining the movie is intensely misogynist . It's not just that both the principal males are portrayed as complete jerks and sexual predators ,  but also that the women are portrayed as almost flawless ,  forming a utopian community which lacks conflict of any kind and which rests on relentless generosity and good humor . Utopias are notoriously dull and this one turns out to be no exception . But it's also interesting to notice what happens  ( and here comes the plot giveaway ,  though it refers to a very early scene )  when the teenage daughter kills her father .  ( 1 )  Her mother rushes to take responsibility for it and ( 2 )  the daughter seems to suffer almost no remorse  ( and in fact her emotional life then disappears from the film )  . It's not quite a glorified killing ,  though Aldomovar's camera lingers on the blood in a bloodthirsty way ,  as though it makes an attractive painting ,  and then it's soaked up and out of sight without bloodying either daughter or mom ,  neither materially nor emotionally . Later the film reveals another killing ,  again by a woman of a man ,   ,  and once again it is a killing which the film implicitly endorses.In short ,  Volver is an ideologically-driven film with an unpleasant and in fact a repugnant ideology ,  and so I write an ideological critique . But apart from that ,  it's just not very interesting . It has none of the depth of ,  say ,  Aldomovar's Talk to Her ,  which I loved.
__label__2	Back in 1994 the Power Rangers had become a huge franchise and t.v . executives at the USA Network were hoping to get in on the action and came up with the Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills ,  in which the evil Emporer Gorganus ,  who looks like he's wearing a home made Darth Vader costume ,  and his talking bird ,  that looks like a rubber dog chew toy ,  come to earth to invade it using giant monsters that look like rejects from a 1970's Godzilla film . Fortunately Nimbar an alien that looks like a giant piece of clear jello recruits four teenagers to defend the earth ,  Nimbar gives them each a tattoo of a different star constellation that allows them to transform into buffed up superheros who look like dancers from an eighties tech no music video ,  they could also combined into a giant knight . Forty episodes were made . The USA Network clearly did not have the money to try to adapt a show from Japan like Power Rangers did ,  and made up this show on their own using the budget of a 1950's scifi film . The fights scenes are generic ,  the special effects are poor ,  and some of the sets look like they could fall down . The actors pretty much realized how ridiculous the show was and pretty much ham it up and overact . I can only imagine their shock when the show was cancel led.
__label__4	Lucio Fulci ,  a director not exactly renowned for his subtlety ,  ill-advisedly tries his hand at black humour in Touch of Death ,  a made for TV movie about Lester Parsons  ( Brett Halsey )  ,  a psycho who seduces and murders rich widows in order to pay his gambling debts .  Starting off with a wonderfully gory scene in which the lethal lothario disposes of his latest victim via chainsaw ,  mincing machine and hungry hogs ,  Touch of Death starts promisingly enough ,  but Fulci soon loses control of proceedings ,  introducing a weird sub-plot involving a mysterious copycat killer and some heavy handed  ' comedic ' scenes . There are several more graphic murders which ,  in true Fulci fashion ,  are extremely violent and gruesome ,  but even the high level of bloodletting doesn't stop this from being one of Fulci's poorer efforts .  As I have found with many of his other movies ,  a comprehensible storyline is not exactly high on the agenda when Lucio is behind the camera . This film has many peculiarities which left me more than little perplexed :  why didn't Lester dispose all of his victims using the dismemberment method seen at the beginning ?  Why are all of his victims either hairy or disfigured ?  What the hell is that ending all about ?   Fulci is considered by many to be one of the  ' greats ' of horror cinema ;  I don't understand his popularity ,  finding the majority of the films of his that I have seen so far to be generally lacking both decent narratives and technical proficiency . Touch of Death certainly does nothing to change my opinion.
__label__4	There are certain horror directors for whom I've built up so much respect  &  admiration over the years ,  that they can't possibly disappoint me know matter what garbage to decide to put on film . Lucio Fulci is surely one of them ,  but damned ,  he's trying to disappoint me with his later efforts !  You can easily afford yourself to skip most of the films Fulci directed or produced during the late 80's and simply watch  " Cat in the Brain "  instead ,  because that one title gathers and repeats the best and absolute goriest footage of no less than SEVEN other Fulci-flicks ,  including the sickest murders sequences featuring in  " When Alice Broke the Mirror "  . As a whole ,  this movie definitely ranks among our director's weakest and most pointless achievements . The script is incoherent as hell ,  the basic premise is totally implausible and somewhat stupid and there's absolutely no suspense to enjoy . I love the title ,  but it's actually quite meaningless . There is a character named Alice in the story ,  but it's only a supportive role and she certainly doesn't break any mirrors . I suppose she could break stuff simply using her voice ,  as she's an opera singer ,  but she doesn't . The plot revolves on a middle-aged and gambling-addicted playboy who spends his days seducing wealthy widows and killing them for their money . Lester Parson butchers the ladies  ( as well as unwelcome witnesses )  in gruesome ways ,  makes steaks out of their juiciest body parts and feeds the remainders to his cat . There's also a silly psychological sub plot in which he thinks his own shadow is responsible for the murders instead of him . The difference between  " When Alice Broke the Mirror "  and some of Fulci's greatest horror films  (  " The Beyond "  ,   " City of the Living Dead "  ,   "  )  lies in the fact that he totally doesn't bother to create a horrific atmosphere . The characters ,  Lester included ,  are colorless and boring and the murders are ordinarily depicted ;  like it's the most common thing in the world to put a woman's head in a microwave or repeatedly run back and forth over a human body with a car . The lighting is poor ,  the cinematography super-ugly ,  the editing clumsy and amateurish and the acting performances are downright miserable . If I didn't know any better ,  I would think Lucio deliberately made a lousy film in order to protest against all the harsh critics that dislike his repertoire no matter how much spirit and effort he put into it . The obvious element to enjoy here is simply the outrageous gore  &  bloodshed ,  because even the attempt to blend in black comedy doesn't work properly . As long as Lester swings around his chainsaw and cuts off women's feet ,   " When Alice Broke the Mirror "  is an undemanding piece of horror entertainment ,  but other than that ,  there's isn't a whole lot to recommend.
__label__2	Lucio Fulci was famous for his Italian splatter movies ,  mostly his undead films like Zombie or The Beyond . Here he directed a black comedy of sorts ,  but there's just one problem :  its nauseating . I say this knowing that I like City of the Walking Dead  ( which is also gross but not like this )  . A compulsive gambler gets money for his habit by romancing ugly and deformed rich women then murdering them and stealing their cash . The film makes this plan look that easy . I guess the women were too ugly to go to a bank ,  so they always had their cash on person . After the upteenth murder I began to suspect what I've always heard about Fulci :  he hated women . He must have . At any rate this film stinks ,  its not funny ,  and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies . Avoid this film at all costs.
__label__1	This latter-day Fulci schlocker is a totally abysmal concoction dealing with an incurable gambler  ( Brett Halsey )  who decides Bluebeard-style to pay off his ever-rising debts by seducing some of the ugliest bitches you will ever lay your eyes on and who just happen to be wealthy widows !  The Fulci-penned script also contrives to incorporate a few blackly comedic elements - which only result in some unfunny business involving a corpse which won't stay put ,  an opera singer victim who won't stop singing ,  etc . - not to mention a doppelganger theme straight out of THE STUDENT OF PRAGUE - although ,  in this case ,  the two personas communicate via pre-recorded radio messages !  !  In the end ,  I can't say I'm surprised that this film shows no sign of the sophistication of Mario Bava's HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON  ( 1970 )  which it resembles in several ways and that it is content to merely pile up the disgustingly gory  ( but none-too-convincing )  effects of dismembered limbs and squashed or melting faces with which ,  alas ,  Fulci had by then become completely associated.
__label__2	This is just dreadful . I regret every second of the 80 minutes I spent watching this dreck . I think it's supposed to be a comedy ,  but I don't remember laughing much ,  except at a few blatant inconsistencies and downright glaring errors .  An unattractive middle-aged man called Lester meets up with rich unattractive middle-aged women via lonely hearts ads ,  and then murders them for the money he needs to feed his gambling addiction . That's the whole plot ,  and that's really all that happens . Along the way there is an attempt at intrigue when Lester starts to get phone calls from a mysterious stranger who taunts him about knowing his secret ,  but its so badly implemented ,  you may not realise what is actually supposed to be happening . The sequences in which Lester murders the rich widows are all quite brutal but also seemingly dressed up as comedies . One sequence has a woman bludgeoned with a wooden pole and then shoved into an oven . It's very cruelly depicted ,  but it is played out against blaring big-band waltz music ,  with Lester pulling faces and adopting comedy poses throughout . Another scene has the victim murdered while she constantly sings shrill opera songs...you have to see this to believe it !  Actually - you don't have to see it at all ,  in fact I strongly recommend you avoid this flop . Fulci does not seem to know which hat he is wearing and there's no evidence of any of the flair seen in his earlier career . One sequence stood out to me as particularly wretched :  the revelation when Lester suddenly realises that he has no shadow . Fulci seems unable to think up any visual representation of this phenomena on screen ,  so from this point on he just films the actor as normal ,  shadow and all !  !  And thus totally blows the whole angle . Either he had zero budget for effects ,  or he just didn't care enough to think up any way of showing it . Whatever it was ,  that should give you a taste of how lame this whole project is . I couldn't even understand most of the film ,  and there certainly wasn't anything on screen worth looking at half the time . Even the ending was as flat as a pancake . A real dud.
__label__4	Hailing from 1988 ,  Touch Of Death is probably the most frustrating Fulci film I've seen to date ,  prompting me to join the chorus of horror fans who generalise that his films get worse as you get later into his career . Considering the plot synopsis ,  I was expecting some bloody bad-natured fun with this one ,  but for all its bizarre flourishes ,  it feels tedious even at a running time of just 80 minutes ,  and suffers from nauseatingly shabby production values and film-making craft  ( or lack thereof )  .  El Story :  A gambling addict widower wines and dines rich  ( and strange )  women he finds via lonely hearts columns before offing them in gruesome fashion - sometimes eating them or feeding them to animals - and stealing their money to keep his debtors at bay . Sure ,  it's unlikely that just one man would be the host for so much screwed-up pathology all at once  ( addict ,  psycho / sociopath ,  cannibal )  ,  but this is Fulci !   Touch is actually the cheapest and sparsest looking Fulci film I've seen . There's almost nobody in it ,  even in the background of shots out on the street ,  for instance . A newsreader who keeps appearing on the film's televisions to warn the non-existent cast about the maniac's latest doings operates out of the most pathetic TV studio on the planet . He never even gets to look at the camera because has to read all the headlines off misaligned sheets of paper .  Some scenes just go on and on with the protagonist muttering to himself about what he's done or what he's about to do ,  but the acting is nowhere near good enough to sustain this kind of thing ,  so the main outcome is viewer boredom . The film also looks bland and ugly in general . I've read that it was intended to be an Italian telemovie  ( did it ever screen in that venue ?  With the amount of gore involved ,  it seems unlikely )  ,  and it does reek of crappy old telemovie production values .  This is also Fulci's first foray into outright black humour ,  but he's just too graceless a director to make it work . Sometimes conspicuously cheerful or  ' wacky ' music is used to play against a gruesome scene ,  for instance while the hero / villain is carving up a dead body in his basement . The effect isn't really chilling or funny or ironic anything that you'd like it to be - it's mostly just hamfisted and crappy .  There are of course some redeeming moments of gore  ( that you'll be waiting for while trying to stay awake )  ,  including the eventual murder by oven (  !  )  of a woman who just won't quit life ,  even after her face has been totally bashed apart with a bloody great club ,  and a homeless guy who gets a car run back and forth over him about five times . The most outrageous element of Touch ,  however ,  is all the physical deformation on the widows courted by the crazy guy . Beards ,  hairy moles ,  messy harelips - it's not like he sought out women with these features ,  it's just the way all lonely hearts widows are ,  apparently . There are plenty of shots of Mr Crazy secretly grimacing while he's smooching up these women . The black humour of such garish misogyny might have some staying power or resonance if the film wasn't so poorly executed in general . In the end ,  Touch Of Death just seems like a really lazy ,  inarticulate mess.
__label__2	Yeah ,  what did I expect ?  I thought this would be a film about young adults at their turning-point in life ,  something like  " Sonnenallee "  or  " American Pie "  ,  which I liked a lot . I wanted to see a funny film ,  perhaps with an ironic look on idyllic Wuerzburg . And what did I get ?   Attention ,  spoilers ahead !   This film starts with a lengthy dialogue which gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow :  more lengthy dialogues . Sometimes I thought Moritz Bleibtreu might have forgotten his text and trying to hide that fact by improvising and just repeating what he was saying before . But as I think of Bleibtreu as one of the better german actors ,  I believe that this effect really was intended . I think the author wanted to show how boring talking to close friends can be - especially when they are stoned . But really ,  I don't need cinema to be bored by stoned friends ' talk . Boring dialogues make up most of this film .  But okay ,  that's one thing . I can cope with that ,  I have seen nice films with abominable dialogues ,  just think of Schwarzenegger's life's work . But the next thing is that characters are cheap and flat and that the storyline is as foreseeable as anything . Just one example  ( SPOILER !  !  )  :  Why ,  do you think ,  does someone take a garden hose to his hemp-plants deep in the forest ?  To water them ?  Of course not ,  usually you don't find water-pipes deep in forests ,  do you ?  The only reason this water-hose is there is that a hunter who happens to come by while the two protagonists are harvesting their dope can be drugged ,  maltreated and finally filled up with three bottles of Jaegermeister . I truly hated this scene ,  because it's really violent . Usually ,  I don't mind violence in films - slapstick-comedies are full of it . But in that sort of comedy there is a silent agreement between the film and you that people don't get hurt if they fall on their faces or get beaten with chairs or things like that . But if that happens in a film which is otherwise realistic enough ,  slapstick-scenes also seem real . In this particular scene in  " Lammbock "  I really thought that this hunter must be badly injured ,  if not dead - the final scene really invoked in me the impression that he is left to die there ,  totally filled up with more booze anyone could handle . And the protagonists just walk away . It would have been otherwise if the author had consistently followed one style ;  the scene could have been quite funny .  Talking about being consistently - that's what I missed most about this film . The whole film seems to be a listing of small episodes that came to the author's mind . Things just happen without a apparent reason - yeah ,  I know ,  that's life ,  but that's not cinema ,  because cinema is meant to tell a story ,  not to show boring episodes without any significance . I found myself asking  " Where's the point ?  "  all the time . Characters besides the two main ones are not elaborated ,  you never get to know why the protagonist's sister wants to sleep with his best friend Kai ,  in fact ,  she tells you but I could not buy it ,  not at all . I think she just was there to give Kai an opportunity to act this childish AIDS-test sketch ,  which you sure have seen a thousand times before ,  and mostly better . The protagonist's girlfriend you meet once ,  then she leaves Germany  ( what you don't even see and the guy doesn't seem to care )  and finally it is mentioned in one sentence that she has met someone else in America and splits up with the protagonist . It seemed to me that the author wanted to tie up a few loose ends . He actually didn't ,  you never really get to know what's so bad about studying law ,  being daddy's son  ( daddy fixes everything in the end and serves coffee in the middle of the night ,  which to my mind made him one of the nicer characters in the whole film )  and living in beautiful Wuerzburg . Even the dinner with daddy's layer-friend ,  which maybe was intended to show how horrible it is to have to live up to dad's expectations ,  seemed flat ,  just another nice dinner with the family's friends  ( except for the trip the guy is on later ,  but I think showing that eating dope before you dine with parents isn't healthy was not the point of this scene ,  if there was any )  . I have experienced far worse dinners in my life than this one and still finished my exams . I couldn't understand one single character in the whole film ,  they just seemed flat and implausible .  All this made it a not-so-good film ,  but not one I wouldn't watch again on television . It really had a few good scenes  ( most of them were not new ,  though ,  like the one with the nice and understanding policemen )  ,  some were really funny ,  some dialogues were nice and I like Bleibtreu's play ,  although he repeated his well-known stereotypes again this time . Not good ,  not abominable ,  that's what I thought after the film was half over .  But then came this incest scene and this I really found repulsive . Incest simply isn't funny . I don't even know if this was intended to be funny ,  some people in the audience laughed ,  so it could have been meant this way . This scene spoiled the whole film for me ,  I couldn't feel sympathy for the protagonist any more - I can't feel sympathy for anyone who f**** a helpless person ,  to me ,  this is rape and rape isn't funny . So it might have been a hint of drama or so ,  but the incest is never again mentioned  ( although we thought this could have been one reason for the protagonist to leave Germany in the end ,  but as it is never mentioned again ,  we don't know . )  ,  it is even totally unnecessary . I almost expected the sister to become pregnant in the end ,  which would just have added the finishing touch to this tasteless story ,  but not even this final cliche is fulfilled ,  just as nothing is really solved or thought through to the end in this film . It isn't really funny ,  it isn't really a drama ,  it isn't at all a road movie a la Tarantino despite desperate tries on violence ,  it is definitely not enjoyable .  Skip this film . Watch  " Final Fantasy "  ,  that's also bad ,  but at least with beautiful pictures and not that tasteless.
__label__4	Countenance !  Antoine Monot ,  in a copycat impersonation of Kevin Smith's Silent Bob ,  keeps asking for it ,  but writer / director Christian Zübert never listens . Zübert just can't say no to a joke ,  no matter how cheap . The best thing about this movie is its soundtrack . Of course ,  Joey Burns of Calexico and the divine Jonathan Richman ,  understated old-school bard of  " There's something about Mary "  fame ,  would grace any small-town dropout story . In visual allure ,  Stefan  ( Lukas Gregorowicz )  looks cool enough riding his tan six-series BMW two-door ,  wearing aviator shades ,  going nowhere . True ,  he *accidentally* sleeps with his wild-eyed bohemian kid sister  ( Marie Zielcke )  ,  but then ,  who wouldn't ?  Thumbs up also to how he goes black-and-white on a liberal dose of that mysterious substance they call zero-zero ,  but if you're looking for a slightly more serious rendering of what intoxication can do to you ,  I suggest you check out  " Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas " .
__label__1	I'm a huge Zack Allan fan and was disappointed that he only got one scene in the movie . This was also my favourite scene where he confiscates a character's weapons and directs her to Down Below . Unfortunately unlike Thirdspace  &  River of Souls ,  most of the action took place off station . I didn't care much for Garibaldi after the first three seasons and think Sheridan is okay but no Sinclair . I like Lochley but she only had limited screen time . If you like Crusade or space battles you should enjoy it . Personally I can only give it 1 / 10.
__label__2	A remake can be successful . An adaptation can be successful . It isn't relevant whether its a remake or an adaptation .  A good movie is a good movie and a poor movie is a poor movie ,  regardless .  Sarkar ,  I am afraid ,  was a very poor movie . First of all ,  just by making characters look dangerous ,  or macho ,  they don't bring in an aura about them .  What was so brilliant about Nagre ( Amitabh Bacchan's character )  that we should have been in aura of his  ' power ' and what showed the  ' benevolence ' of the character ?  Nothing .  This fact was said by a commentator and Amitabh kept giving facial expressions . Now Amitabh can give brilliant facial expressions but why should it mean any thing if there is no history or story to go with it .  There wasn't proper charecterisation of the characters who worked under  ' sarkar ' too . Just because a man had spectacles ,  why should we assume he is wise . ] The flow of the movie was generally dullbecause scenes from the Godfather were created  ( like the policeman slapping Abhishek Bacchan )  ,  the older brother being killed by Abhishek  ( like Fredo was killed on instructions of Pacino )  but too much was sought to be packed into the movie with too little story and depth to go with it . That was indeed the problem .  If you try to pack 3 hours of intricate detail like a Godfather in 2 hours and that too with few dialogues ,  what you get is a highlights show from a cricket match ,  never making the full impact watching a full match will make.
__label__3	What on earth happened to RGV ?  There are so many things wrong about this movie that one needs to stop and decide where to start- first and worst - the music . Every scene was accompanied with this pretentious background music that was telling you the mood ,  quite pathetically ,  I might add . Secondly ,  the lighting - do we really need such dark scenes where we are wondering if the projector is still working ?  And finally - if you are going to Indianise the Godfather and Godfather 2 - please realize that a lot of us have seen in . Nayakan was a ripoff of GF1 but better done ,  and more entertaining . I have seen a similarity in both Company and Sarkar and while RGV's Ab Tak 56 was brilliant ,  these two movies leave something to be desired . People will not be impressed any more by just corrupt politicians and the lot . Maybe RGV should see Maqbool ,  which is good enough to be RGV !  ! 
__label__3	At the beginning of the movie ,  Ramgopal Verma says that  " Sarkar "  is his tribute to The Godfather . This one feels more like an insult . It pales terribly in comparison to the Coppola classic . Although no one was expecting Ramgopal Verma to fill Coppola's shoes ,  the movie did create a lot of expectation and buzz .   Amitabh Bachchan plays  " Sarkar "  ,  a character automatically drawing instant comparisons to Indian political party Shiv Sena's Supremo Bal Thackeray . Abhishek Bachchan plays his son Shankar who returns from abroad and gets caught up in Sarkar's politics at home . Just like Al Pacino in the original Godfather .   As most Bollywood fare ,  incidents and characters are overtly simplistic and devoid of any kind of solid foundation . Quick phone calls and sudden announcements turn the film from one direction to another . Abishek takes to Mumbai's murky underworld politics-crime nexus like a duck takes to water . Amithab Bachchan as Sarkar is supposed to look magnificent and powerful ,  he just ends up looking old and clueless . Most of his acting is centered around constantly staring at different things around the movie set - the actor in front of him ,  the floor or in some other random direction .   However ,  Kay Kay performs exceedingly well as the wronged elder son Vishnu . So does Zakir Hussain as Rashid ,  the Dubai based dope smuggler who wants to gets his footing in Mumbai . This actor has awesome screen presence and can send chills down your spine with just the way he looks . The moment he enters the screen ,  you want to run and hide under the bed .   All its obvious flaws not withstanding ,  the film did well at the box office . The buzz and the big star cast obviously helping . Also Verma manages to hold your interest albeit mildly towards the later half of the film . He is actually making a sequel to this one which I am sure will be more of the same fare.
__label__4	Dear Mr Ram Gopal Varma ,  I don't know in which capacity I am writing this letter to you . I am a never-say-he's-finished Amitabh Bachchan fan ,  having sat through his cock-chasing act in Jaadugar . I also demand some important designation in The Godfather fan club ,  having watched the Coppola classic more times than you have delivered flops from your Factory . And ,  of course ,  I have been a big admirer of yours ,  right from the time you had Nagarjuna wrapping the cycle chain around his knuckles in Shiva .  When you announced Sarkar and called it your take on Godfather ,  all one wanted to know was the date the first look would be out ,  the Sunday the promos would go on air ,  the Friday the film would be released . It was sheer wish fulfillment at work knowing that you ,  and not someone hovering between the mustard fields of Amritsar and the tulip gardens of Amsterdam ,  had taken up the task of recreating the Puzo pages on the Bollywood big screen .  Your cast couldn't have been more you  working for the first time with the legend ,  casting Abhishek as his screen-son ,  giving Kay Kay a role he has deserved for years ,  bringing back forgotten faces like Supriya Pathak and Rukhsar ,  and picking complete non-actors like Katrina and Tanishaa to join the list Before July 1 ,  you had made Sarkar the most-awaited film ever for any Godfather freak who worshiped Bachchan .  The opening credits stoked the hope that your stunning sepia-tinted promos on the telly had kindled . But now ,  you labeled Sarkar your tribute to Godfather instead of the word  " inspired "  which you had been using all along . Probably you don't want the two creations to be compared but when the medium is the same ,  then a Kaante would be compared to Reservoir Dogs and a Reservoir Dogs to a City On Fire .  Also ,  when your first and last sequences  the heart of any screenplay treatment  are all about the establishment and the transfer of power ,  you can't keep the Nagares and the Corleones apart ,  even if you replace the American mafia moves with Maharashtrian political power play .  But you got it wrong ,  Mr Varma You wanted to show Amitabh in his 70s avatar ,  as rustled up by the pens of Salim-Javed . You wanted him to lurk around larger than life . You wanted him to be his own brand ( o )  . Then how could you steal his voice in the name of using silence ?  How could you keep him rooted to his chair in the hunt for interesting camera angles ?  How could you leave him stranded without his voice and stature ,  the two things that have made his B so big ?  Coppola's Godfather cameraman Gordon Willis masked Brando's eyes throughout the movie because it didn't have the power to match that drawling husky voice or that sudden snap of the fingers . But you tried to repeat the Malik act from your very own Company . But Bachchan is no Ajay Devgan  his forte doesn't lie in the stagnant stare and the suffocating silence . You made the man look like a comatose patient ,  who's reminded from time to time to look at the cue cards and mouth those predictable one-liners . For that ,  Agneepath's there ,  any given Saturday .  Which Bachchan fan would go and watch Kay Kay Menon stealing the thunder from under his nose in the scene where Sarkar asks Vishnu to leave his house ?  Which Amitabh aficionado would go and watch him focus on achaar and carom ,  in a film that talks about power with a capital P in the promos ?  We can't handle so much in the name of restraint and understatement !  You don't even allow the camera to rest on him for five seconds when he learns that his son wanted to kill him . Give me the old-school camera-only-on-Bachchan style ,  any given Saturday .  Kudos to you ,  of course ,  for making an actor out of Abhishek ,  first in Naach and now in Sarkar . You also allow him to show Mallika Sherawat that he can run as well as his father . Even in the short prison sequence ,  you really make the Bachchans come out of the text ,  an opportunity Shaad missed in Bunty Aur Babli . Wish the film could have been more a father-son story rather than a chaotic conflict between caricatures in the name of characters ,  who pop up like the ad windows on the Internet .  You also let the women more into the script than Puzo and Coppola did and again ,  you deserve all the Brownie points for squeezing them in so effectively . Pathak is a welcome return as the mother in the middle ,  Tanishaa lovable as the lovelorn girl ,  Katrina a revelation as Abhishek's confused lover and Rukhsar's silence speaks volumes .  But sub-plots do not a classic remake . When your free-flowing camera tries to make every frame look hatke and your loud background score irritates incessantly ,  we keep getting reminded that we are in a Factory . Well ,  maybe not a Nino Rota score but Sarkar certainly deserved better than those Govinda ,  Govinda chants and uncalled-for flute interludes .  Mr Varma ,  some of your Factory directors tell me that you are involved with every project ,  from overseeing the shooting schedules to supervising the editing sessions . Perhaps ,  in the middle of all the various storyboards ,  the Bhiku Matre scream is being muted by the Subhash Nagare silence . Perhaps ,  you need to bring the shutters down on the factory and work on a single homemade product . Otherwise ,  your products would remain products ,  to use and throw ,  not treasure . And movie buffs like me ,  for whom there are no hits and flops ,  only good cinema ,  would rather choose a film without Factory finish ,  any given Saturday.
__label__4	It is disappointing to see as talented an actor as Amitabh Bachchan in such a weak role ,  especially when he was beyond sensational in BLACK  ( which I highly recommend )  . One line in the film states :   " Sakar is not a mere man ,  he is a thought and a philosophy . "  Director Ram Gopal Varma credits THE GODFATHER as an inspiration for this movie ,  and perhaps that is the problem . It seems like a badly mangled American movie set in India . The Left Elbow Index considers seven elements of film-making--acting ,  continuity ,  plot ,  character development ,  dialogue ,  artistry ,  and production sets--on a scale from a high of 10 to a low of 1 ,  with 5 given as a average score . The film continuity seems high ,  an 8 ,  by maintaining a violent tone infused with drama in places ,  and using justice outside the legal system as motivation . However ,  there seems to be a lack of emotion connected with the evil of organized crime . The acting rates a 4 ,  it appears too weak ,  even when someone is being beaten or murdered ,  it seems hoohum . For example ,  when one character is shot in the forehead ,  I found myself wondering if ,  or when ,  he was going to fall . He does not ,  and ala Ronald Reagan he is placed in an automobile ,  with his bleeding face cradled ala John F . Kennedy . The plot rates a 5 as an example of American-style gangsterism ,  with a family oriented Robinhood at its head . Character development appears static ,  and the characters seem like chess pieces on an abandoned chess board ,  thereby earning a rank of 3 . The dialogue seems stilted ,  and appears to be forced to fit some Bowery pattern of speech--a 4 for dialogue . Production sets look to be below average--a 4 . And ,  artistry is puzzling ,  with far too many close-ups ,  too rapid panning ,  and too many group scenes where the actors seem over rehearsed--a 3 . To me ,  too much camera movement is disruptive . The average of the Left Elbow Index is 4.4 ,  and with a slight deduction based on poor derivatism it moves down to a 4 . Two questions continually arise in the film :  one ,  why are so many people eating so often :  and ,  two ,  does not India have its own brand of organized crime ?  Do films like this have to be so dependent on Western cultural examples ?  As much as I like Amitabh Bachchan ,  I cannot recommend this film.
__label__4	I was expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachan's role of SARKAR ,  but am disappointed . Being a Ram Gopal Verma's direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie . Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character ,  but the movie shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his . There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead . The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan ,  not his son . Amitabh Bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things . The movie fails to show the strong impact of God Father.
__label__4	Yet another version of mother of all gangster flicks-the Classic  " Godfather "  and yet another case of over-hype due to media circus . Sarkar ,  the 13th Hindi film of Ram Gopal Varma as director is also the weakest in his Underworld trilogy including the other two being the excellent-Satya and Company . The Charisma ,  the magnetic persona of the two Bachchans playing father-son duo on screen for the first time is definitely a treat to watch out for . Not just strong performances but their perfect chemistry is the biggest scoring point here for which Varma should be applauded . However ,  the same equation of the duo is missing with the other characters in the film . Reason-the other characters look more like cardboard caricatures esp . the villains represent the typical Bollywood baddies . A character who attracts attention is elder son played by Kaykay but again not able to hold due to half-baked characterization .  . The Drama and conflict is brought alive by the excessive use of Close-shots ,  which brought a claustrophobic effect rightly needed to construct an ambiance . The haunting Score  ( Amar Mohile )  and the sound design  ( Kunal Mehta ,  Parikshit Lalwani  &  Anup Dev )  ,  together with dark ,  murky background overlapped by shinning powerful images  ( camerawork by Amit Roy )  contributes to Visuals so typical of Ramu's style . But there is an overuse of Music though fortunately no songs are there in the film . But can interest of today's  " intelligently growing "  audience be sustained just on shoulders of two performers and strong Visuals  ?  I don't think so . Surely ,  audience  " maangey more "  and here film fails to deliver . In any adaptation ,  in order to add a new dimension ,  the biggest pre-requisite is the Screenplay ,  which is sluggish here not being crisp at places ,  and therefore the pace slackens quite often . What finally audience is subjected to is a highly predictable ,  very commonplace drama with very little surprise elements . Top Stunt director Allan Amin Ghani is also not in his best form . Some scenes which require a different treatment includes- a Minister is talking foul about Sarkar and the son is overhearing ;  a very amateurish shoot out in the jail on Sarkar ,  Sarkar Jr . escapes from the clutches of his enemies ,  a Son easily motivated to kill his own father ,  a son is secretly entering his father's room to kill him ,  a police commissioner slapping Sarkar Jr-all this requires a more realistic ,  hard-hitting approach which is the back-bone to create the required conflict . The dialogues are weak for eg . look at an amateurish line where a CM says to Sarkar Jr .  " Wo jo Police Commissioner tha na usay maine hata diya "  ... The women folk take on Sarkar's working is completely ignored . The uninterrupted negotiations about criminal activities while Sarkar is with his family also look slightly out of place In fact ,  the film follows a graph quite similar to Ramu's own production-Ab Tak Chhappan . In depicting the battle between good and evil ,  the other side of life-the law ,  police ,  administration ,  politics is completely ignored . Certainly ,  more is expected in content . Here the film definitely falls short and could not rise above an average fare . Dear Ramu ,  agreed that now you are laughing your way to the bank ,  you definitely need to take some drastic overhauling measures in your film production factory ,  before it is too late.
__label__2	This movie was obviously made with a very low budget ,  but did they have to make it so obvious ?  It looked like they made no effort to make the  " future "  look in the least futuristic . For example ,  the first scene takes place in an 80's office building and all the cars that get blown up are from the late 70's  ( I assume they didn't want to blow up cars that cost more than  $ 500 )  . Additionally ,  its pretty obvious that Don  " the Dragon "  is driving his personal car during the movie  ( after all ,  he did partially fund the film )  . Finally ,  they point out at the beginning of the film that all kinds of drugs are now legal in this new  " cyberpunk "  society . Not only does this never become important in the film ,  but later when don needs surgery without anesthesia ,  why doesn't he just go out and get some legal heroin or morphine ?  The whole movie is sloppy like this and completely anticlimactic since Don easily blows up an  " unstoppable "  Cybertracker about 25 minutes into the movie . However ,  if you find this movie cheap or free I'd watch it ,  the last scene is almost worth putting up with this whole film.
__label__3	CyberTracker is set in Los Angeles sometime in the near future where bodyguard Eric Phillips  ( co-producer Don  ' The Dragon ' Wilson )  saves senator Robert Dilly  ( John Aprea )  from an assassination attempt by a group known as the UHR ,  the Union of Human Rights ,  who are angry at Dilly for spearheading the Computerised Judicial System in which robots called CyberTrackers are sent out to determine  &  dispense justice on the guilty . Anyway ,  Eric saves Dilly who is very impressed  &  decides to see if he can trust Eric in his shady activities like the cold blooded murder of a traitor ,  being the fine upstanding guy that he is Eric isn't impressed when Dilly kills a woman  &  he is asked to keep it quiet . Eric escapes  &  sets out to bring Dilly down ,  however Dilly has lots of powerful friends  &  he uses his influence to frame Eric  &  have his CyberTrackers sent out in pursuit of him ...  Co-produced  &  directed by Richard Pepin I think films like CyberTracker give films a bad name ,  I didn't like it that much at all . The script by Jacobsen Hart is pretty predictable ,  it doesn't excite ,  it steals most of it's ideas  &  theme from other better sci-fi films  &  the heady mix of martial arts action  &  sci-fi don't gel that well . There a few fights ,  some car chases  &  a couple of shoot outs but it's all rather bland  &  forgettable . The film lacks imagination considering the film is set in the future  &  it deals with robots ,  technology  &  the way society is run  &  it's judicial system in particular . Speaking of which the fantastic Robocop  ( 1987 )  mixed it's violent action  &  clever social commentary brilliantly but CyberTracker doesn't even try to make any relevant social statement or try to portray any meaningful moral message about law enforcement ,  the script basically uses the concept to have robots  &  shoot outs which Robocop did as well but also managed to include a good story . There is very little in CyberTracker that I can say was entertaining  &  that's what films are about right ?   Director Pepin does OK but nothing stands out ,  it's all rather forgettable  &  it's not particularly exciting . The sci-fi elements are nothing more than the robot side of things  &  as a whole the film doesn't look that futuristic . The action scenes are alright ,  there's some exploding cars  &  some shoot outs but nothing spectacular .  Technically CyberTracker is average ,  for a film supposedly set in the future it already looks dated  &  the special effects are poor . The acting was bad ,  I wonder if Don  ' The Dragon ' Wilson signs cheques with that name ?   CyberTracker was a waste of my time ,  there is nothing here original or exciting  &  the action is instantly forgettable . Poor  &  that's all that needs to be said ,  not recommended.
__label__3	Eric Phillips  ( Don Wilson )  is a secret service agent who prevents the assassination of a senator however along the way he finds a conspiracy and has a tracker on his tail . The tracker by the way is bent on terminating Phillips . The most obvious inspiration for this low budget cheeseball action flick ,  is of course Robocop and while that film had some imagination and real energy ,  this just has a real life kickboxing champ running away from a robot . The movie isn't so awful as it is just empty and repetitive . The story is written in clichés and the characters are set up to be cut down by the various gunfire . Don Wilson ,  as usual ,  is terrible in the lead role .  *1 / 2 out of 4- ( Poor ) 
__label__4	Plot Synopsis :  Los Angeles in the future . Crime is kept under control by Core Trackers ,  android assassins dispatched by the United States Computerized Judicial System to execute the guilty . Secret Service agent Eric Phillips prevents an attack on his boss ,  Senator Robert Dilly  ( the man who set up the USCJS )  ,  by the Union for Human Rights ,  a group of anti-machine activists . Dilly attempts to initiate Phillips into his private circle but the SS agent goes on the run after witnessing Dilly murder a UHR agent in cold blood . Dilly sends Core Trackers after him . Phillips joins the UHR group  &  helps them uncover a conspiracy involving Dilly .   " Cyber Tracker "  is the first of a number of sci-fi  /  action hybrids directed by Richard Pepin ,  co-founder of PM Entertainment ,  a powerhouse of action films during the 1990s . Other Pepin films include  " Hologram Man "  ,   " T-Force "  ,   " The Silencers "   &   " Dark Breed "  . Pepin films typically start with a major action sequence which lasts about 10 minutes before allowing the plot to kick in . The script for this film has a few plot holes  it is never clear what the conspiracy the heroes are trying to stop actually is . As for the acting ,  Don  " The Dragon "  Wilson may be tough but cannot act for beans ,  with little charisma . His co-stars are a lot better . The film's best bet are the action scenes ,  which throw up some impressive artillery fire ,  a huge bodycount  &  not one but three moments where a vehicle flies through the air ,  flips  &  hits the ground ,  exploding . The visual effects border on the cheap side  &  the musical score is low-key  &  shrill.
__label__1	Oh ,  dear !  This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen . It's unbelievably repetitive ;  every scene seems to consist of people being gunned down ,  running round screaming ,  or being kicked in the face ,  which quickly becomes very dull . I wouldn't mind if the combat was even any good ,  but it isn't ;  the main character Phillips pushes the various goons over with ridiculous ease ,  and no matter how often he stands in full view of the Tracker ,  he never gets hit ,  even though extras and minor characters are being shot and blown up all around him . I've rarely seen a worse cast of actors  ( especially Don Wilson ,  if you can even call him an  " actor "  )  but that's not really surprising ,  given the dialogue they have to work with  ( sample line :   " Computers killed my brother !  "  )  . The plot is a sub-par ripoff of the excellent Terminator ;  the special effects are laughable . Overall ,  this film is just utterly dreadful . And why does everything explode ? 
__label__1	This movie was sooo bad . It wasn't even funny at all . Not even the sarcastic scenes were funny . Oh man ,  bad ,  so bad . Thumbs down . Spoofed ,  Karate Kid ,  Teen Wolf ,  Footloose ,  Dirty Dancing ,  Some Kind of Wonderful ,  Soul Man ,  and probably another or two . Chris Kattan at his very worst as the high school janitor who is a talented dancer ,  who runs a dance studio in a warehouse . He has a jealous girlfriend ,  who breaks her ankle and her dance spot goes to the cute blonde newcomer who Chris has eyes for . I thought the acting was really bad . I like laugh out loud comedies ,  this was not one .  " Not Another Teen Movie "  wasn't funny ,  but had a lot more funny scenes than Totally Awesome .  " Scary Movie "  is suuuper funny . I always laugh when I watch those ,  super enjoyable . This movie ,  not funny.
__label__2	Okay , I had watched this movie when I was very little and the day that we were cleaning out the closet I see this ! I thought ,  " I have no idea of what this movie was like ,  " so I went ahead and put it in.OH MY GOD !  !  !  !  ! This film is so darn bad ! I never thought that this film could ever get as close to my least favorite film as it did , but I did laugh , because all the jokes were so corny and ridiculous , not funny !  !  !  ! So much stuff in this movie was funny , because it was SO STUPID !  !  !  ! This film is not anywhere near good.I would have to say if you want to watch this movie you definitely better not expect anything big and if you've already seen it , trust me , I feel your pain as well !  !  !  ! 
__label__1	If you and your friends find as much humor and enjoyment from horrible acting ,  jokes ,  props ,  and overall film making as me and my friends ,  you need to rent this .  From simply reading the tag line and seeing how not funny it is ,  you should assume more not funny ,  poor quality ,  great ,  hilarious content through out . Its a tale of some of kids who defy every law of physics and reality and fly back in time through a modern day big screen TV to a world of dinosaurs who eventually become their friends . Not to mention a hilariously serious scene where T-Rex becomes a father figure for one of the kids . Yeah ...  It should be in the comedy section but you'll find it with kid movies if you find it at all . So call your friends over ,  sit back ,  relax ,  get ready to laugh ,  and enjoy . You will be quoting the laughably horrific one liners in this movie for weeks .  " Whats with all the ruckus ?  !  " 
__label__2	Saw this at the video store and thought I'd give it a try . Sounded like a good story and the cover looked good . That was it . The characters looked good ,  and the actor who played  " Noel "  ,  was the most convincing ,  though he didn't have any heavy time in the movie . I find it really hard to give a movie a bad rating ,  but this is one ,  in a minute number ,  that gets it my book . As the movie went along I kept wanting it to get better but to no avail . Asthetically ,  it was good . The sound and lighting was good ,  but the acting in this film killed it for me . It was like watching a low grade soap opera . I just kept saying ,   " I can't believe they released this move like this "  . I paused several times out of sheer unbelief that the acting was that bad . There's so much I want to say but I'll just say this ,  everything else ,  for the most part ,  was good ,  it was the acting ,  as a final cut ,  that really did this film in.
__label__1	I'm sorry ,  but I cannot understand what people were smoking when they wrote how great they thought  " Ethan Mao "  was . I have seen better acting ,  character and plot development in pornos !  WARNING :  I am going to give away a key element to the  " plot "  . After holding his family hostage overnight ,  Ethan lets his vile ,  evil ,  hated step-mom go to the bank - ALONE !  !  !  - to retrieve the piece of his late mom's jewellery which he so desperately wants . Guess what ?  She calls the cops !  Wow  ... what a twist !  I couldn't see that coming at all .  The only good thing about this movie was that it was less than 90 minutes .  Pure ,  unadulterated rubbish ! 
__label__4	I'm very interested in the overwhelmingly positive reviews here . While it had some good features ,  for the most part I found this movie to be heavy handed ,  predictable ,  and ,  worst of all ,  not in the least bit scary . The first 30 minutes of the movie were promising ,  the actress did a nice job in her portrayal ,  and the world around her was well thought out and meaningful . Unfortunately ,  from there ,  the movie entered into a downward spiral . I went into this movie with no clue as to what it would be about-- didn't know anything about the actors ,  directors ,  genre ,  etc . At a certain point ,  my wife made the comment  " is this supposed to be a scary movie ?  "  . Well I suppose so ,  as the boiler-plate  " horror movie "  score full of squeaking violins and extended vibrato could mean nothing else . There didn't seem to be a whole lot of originality in the movie ,  the romantic interest was painfully obvious from the first moment ,  and the second half of the movie descended deep into the realm of the ridiculous . A movie like this walks a dangerously narrow path ,  and unfortunately there comes a point where the viewer must decide whether to continue walking along that path ,  or to jump off and simply laugh at the ridiculousness of it all . For the final 30 minutes ,  I chose the latter.
__label__3	This was the first feature film for just about everyone involved ,  including director Teck Tan ,  so they deserve credit for pulling it off . But this film was awkward in its direction ,  preachy in its style ,  exaggerated in its acting ,  and overly politically correct . The plot was all over the place ,  preventing any aspect of it from developing well . Gangsters get involved in the story ,  though i'm not sure what their presence added to the movie other than making the film even more unrealistic . They could have been completely left out and the film would have been better as a result .  The plot is about a young ethnic Chinese Malaysian who returns to his home country after studying in the West . His studies have brought him back with the skills he thinks he needs to fulfill his dream of managing a rock band and taking them to the top of Malaysian charts  ( a rather juvenile premise )  . The beginning of the film hints at conflict with his traditional father ,  but once the gangsters get involved this part of the story is dropped unceremoniously .  The film tries to take advantage of Malaysia's wondrously diverse ethnic mix ,  but unfortunately the manner in which these aspects were put to film either seemed terribly contrived or downright preachy . There is a pretty scene of Malay women doing a beautiful traditional dance on a beach ,  but the way the vision is integrated into the plot seems forced and unnatural .  The acting came off as somewhat amateurish ,  and the male lead was particularly unconvincing . The female Malay lead was a notable exception leaving the most positive mark . The film also has an openly gay character ,  and though he is a bit of a caricature ,  he provides some of the funnier moments in the film . But the movie was just barely a notch above a typical local television soap drama . Sadly ,  this film ,  which is not in the least offensive ,  has been banned in Malaysia . 3 / 10
__label__1	To call this film a complete waste of celluloid would be an understatement .  The acting was unconvincing to say the least ,  especially from actor Craig Fong ,  who couldn't have acted stiffer . As far as story goes...well...what story ?  !  The  " film "  is nominally about Harry Lee ,  a Malaysian of Chinese descent who comes back to his home country after flunking out of every course he took and tries to start a band .  The film has ever cliche you can think of -- sex ,  tension among band members and a little bit of racial tension thrown in .  The problem is that even with a subject that's been covered adequately by even the most amateurish directors ,  this movie is all over the place and the whole thing just feels contrived with parts that would make even the most hardened reviewers ' hairs stand on end.
__label__1	Oh ,  the horror ,  the unspeakable horror of this film . If you can even call it a film . This looks like some first-year art school project ,  hastily cobbled together .  The  " talents "  here will subject you to a painful mix of under- and- overacting ,  and practically all the scenes were terribly contrived and pretentious .  The film in no way reflects Malaysian culture or social conventions - nobody even talks that way over here . I live in Malaysia ,  BTW .  Spinning Gasing seems tailor-made to pick up an award in the foreign film category of some western film festival . And unfortunately ,  that ploy seems to have worked . Some reviewers would no doubt describe it as  " exotic "  ,  but a more accurate word would be  " atrocious " .
__label__3	Yep . Those of my generation who grew up watching those old Sunbow cartoons were spoiled . The 80's Joe tune was one of the best cartoons in the history of television . Well written stories ,  well developed characters . Granted it was nothing more that a glorified toy commercial but it definitely helped carry that toy line . Fast forward almost twenty years later and enter Valor vs . Venom . The animation was average at most . The movement of the characters seemed to jerky and puppet like . The movie felt more like a Small Soldiers sequel than a story about a special military force . Then we have character development or lack there of . Dusty likes to be all Dusty ?  Slice and Dice like to do things together ?  What ?  Did the writers take a writing course on how to develops characters with the depth equivalent of Jar Jar Binks ?  As for the story . I like a bit of Sci-Fi . But that whole concept of turning soldiers into a mutant army has been done to death in the Joe universe . Mega Monsters or Toxo-zombies anyone ?  But I give the creators credit for trying to make the fan boys happy by having martial arts action every 10 minutes . I'm not a huge fan of SE and SS but I did like the fight scenes between the two . If you can appreciate VvV for what it is you will enjoy it . I admit to not being able to appreciate VvV as I should . Again everything Joe gets compared to what ways done in the 80's ,  and honestly nothing will ever compare to the glory days of GI Joe . If you can appreciate VvV for what it is you will enjoy it.
__label__2	Dumb excuse for a thriller with absolutely zero chemistry or reason in relationship between Lewis and Hurt  ( why is she dating a man old enough to be her father anyway ?  ?  The suspense is laughable . Lewis is very good ,  but a script is needed ,  and there isn't one . My score for this trash :  2 out of 10.
__label__2	Unfortunately ,  this movie is absolutely terrible . It's not even laughably bad ,  just plain bad . The actors do their best with what is the cheesiest script ever . How scary can a movie be when the climax actually involves a roomful of millions of styrofoam peanuts ? 
__label__3	My wife invited my son and I to watch this on cable TV on a lazy Saturday evening ,  thinking that it might show an unusual role for Juliette Lewis . On this promise ,  at least ,  the movie delivers :  her character is ineffectual ,  adhering to nearly every slasher-type horror movie cliche . As does the movie . A cataloguing of its studied adherence to them would be an exercise in recall of something I hope to quickly forget ,  so I won't make one . Basically ,  this is a whodunnit ,  heavy on the red herrings :  everybody appears guilty ,  rather than just the two one suspects from the beginning . The  " rule out the logical and obvious ,  and what's left is it "  rule of bad horror movies works well on this one . The only surprise to have any impact on me was its final snagging of the indeterminate ending cliche :  will Jane keep her appointment with her attempted rescuer ,  who will tell her the  ( obvious to the audience )  identity of the 2nd conspirator ,  propelling her into another round of hysterical victim-play . Mercifully ,  I will never know.
__label__4	'The 4th Floor ' is a decidedly mediocre film starring Juliette Lewis as a young interior designer with a heck of a problem neighbor . Jane  ( Lewis )  has recently inherited a terrific 5th floor apartment from her grandmother ,  and per agreement with the landlord ,  gets a ridiculously low renting rate . Her boyfriend  ( William Hurt as a creepy weather man )  wants her to move in with him ,  but she wants her own space . So she moves in ,  and weird stuff starts happening ,  and because this is a B-grade horror flick ,  there's a dumb ,  not-to-be-found-in-reality reason why . As the none-too-intriguing Jane keeps trying to tell others- her boyfriend ,  the police ,  coworkers- what's going on ,  everybody thinks she's losing it . So ,  of course ,  she has to face the problem- the lunatic living right below her- alone . Neither scary nor interesting ,  The movie's single saving grace is Lewis . She's a very fine actress but poorly used here ,  which is not to say she isn't the best thing about this flick- because she is . She has feral charisma and holds the screen better than a dozen of the silicone bimbos that routinely populate this type of movie . This type of movie ,  though ,  is not worthy of her- which is ironic ,  given that she's probably the only reason anyone would see it.
__label__4	A fine line up of actors and a seemingly nice plot -- though not original -- promised me a nice evening in front of the TV . I was disappointed . The actors delivered up to standard  ( Juliette Lewis cuddly as ever ;  William Hurt solid but in the background ;  Shelley Duvall convincing as ever )  but the story was too thin to keep me engaged to the story and ,  the twist to the finale was too obvious and too late ;  there was only one character who was nice to he girl ,  so guess what ?  !  Then the final after-twist I do not know what to think of that . The boyfriend and the neighbor ?  Contract with the Devil ,  or just to get her to move in ?  What !  The film had a nice idea behind it ,  but the idea was not worked out in detail . It could have been good ,  but it was not . Too many loose ends to tie up ,  Columbo would say.
__label__3	There's only one thing I'm going to say about cat in the hat...as a KIDS movie and a good comedy movie it sucks...I lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren't exactly kid appropriate . Oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying...as for the plot I completely forgot . Who cares it sucked anyway . i'm not sure why Mike Myers joined but I think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in Austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded- but so what it was annoying . don't see it-it belongs in the bottom 100 ... the jokes are so unkiddy it's funny
__label__1	Shame Shame Shame on UA / DW for what you do !    I was appalled .   Do NOT take kids to see this movie . The humor is totally inappropriate for children - plus they'll be bored and disappointed . Certainly *we all* have read Theo's wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations...but this is pure trash . Dr . Seuss would be ashamed and certainly would've never given his  " thumbs up "  at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic .  What a pity .   Spend your money on the book . If you own a copy ,  then buy the book and donate it to a Toys for Tots program . This movie is NOT worth a  " free "  ticket viewing .  Stick with the book . The tv cartoon version works well if you want a visual portrayal - save your money...seriously . SAVE your money - it will be on cable by saint patty's day .  Shame shame shame on what they do !  ! 
__label__7	I caught this movie on the Sci-Fi channel recently . It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror / suspense films go . Two guys  ( one naive and one loud mouthed a** )  take a road trip to stop a wedding but have the worst possible luck when a maniac in a freaky ,  make-shift tank / truck hybrid decides to play cat-and-mouse with them . Things are further complicated when they pick up a ridiculously whorish hitchhiker . What makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually work in this movie ,  unlike so many others . The two guys are likable enough and there are some good chase / suspense scenes . Nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horror / slasher buff . Definitely worth checking out.
__label__9	Five minutes in ,  i started to feel how naff this was looking ,  you've got a completely unheroic hero and his overweight fool of a friend . Seen it all before ,  yeah right . I was getting ready to be bored out of my mind for a good few hours . This is something i have become quite used to ... haven't we all . Then after a few minutes of testosterone fuelled insults and such ,  the truck appeared . Okay the filming techniques used to make it look fast were clumsy ,  but who cares !  That truck is amazing !  Soon however that is taken away again and we're back to the geek and his overweight friend . But now i'm satisfied that at least it won't be too terrible . I then proceed to be amazed again and again by the cleverness of the film . There are so many jokes at their expense ,  it's like everyone in the world is in on this except the two of them . The mind behind the makeup and effects was a genius i swear it . Believe me ,  if you are a man you miss so many of the jokes in this film ,  there is so much here that only a girl can understand .  Brother Bob is by far the best hillbilly killer that can be found anywhere ,  the fact that he's sewn together just adds to the effect . There are of course some really dud science facts in here ,  but isn't that always the case . When our  ' hero ' is having a nose bleed and using the blood to lead brother Bob to his death ,  now that is rubbish . There is no way a nose bleed can be that bad and not mean a severed artery or something . I'm all with the use of too much blood ,  but that is taking it a little too far . The incest jokes are a little predictable but funny nonetheless . And the way brother bob meets his end is more than classic . Overall ,  this movie rules ,  it really breaks out of the overacted melodramatic strain of horror that we got so much of in 2003-2005 . The end of this move simply could not have been better .  This is a definite must watch for anyone who likes their horror with several side orders of gore and attitude.
__label__7	I got Monster Man in a box set of three films where I mainly wanted the other two but still had a very pleasant time with it . It blends horror and comedy to reasonable effect ,  helped out considerably by the decent performances of Eric Jungman as the geeky lead ,  Justin Urich as his a hole friend and Aimee Brooks as the love interest . The film is fairly predictable and mines ideas from a host of other films ,  but stays fun throughout ,  with some good gruesome gore thrown in . Sure it doesn't measure up to the classic gory comedies ,  but this still does fine . Director Michael Davis even manages one or two creepy scenes ,  such as in the bathroom ,  or the bar . The film is watchable throughout if a little messily plotted and written and for me it only lost it a bit towards the end when the Monster Man of the title starts to resemble a member of Slipknot and the film tries to go more horror style but isn't twisted or convincing enough . The final moments are a trifle weak as well . Still ,  despite lack of much suspense and overall silliness ,  this is a good example of unpretentious ,  often gnarly splatter comedy that should endear itself to fans of the same.
__label__8	I got this as part of a competition prize . I watched it ,  not really expecting much from an obviously low budget production . I laughed myself sick ! There are obvious references to other films in the horror genre - Texas Chain Saw Massacre ,  Friday 13th etc . All the standard clichés were there - long drive through partially arid and somehow menacing countryside ,  inbred red-necks ,  mysterious vehicles tracking you - throw in some really good humorous scenes  ( siphoning petrol from the camper-van )  and dialogue  (  " f*****g virgin ?  That's got to be an oxymoron ... "  and you have one of the best spoof horror films for years . I particularly liked the way our reluctant hero used his stress-related nose-bleed to great advantage..
__label__10	Just got around to seeing Monster Man yesterday . It had been a long wait and after lots of anticipation and build up ,  I'm glad to say that it came through and met my expectations on every level . True ,  you really can't expect too much from hearing the plot rundown ,  but after reading some of the reviews for it ,  I was ecstatic . I mean ,  what trash fan wouldn't want to see a gore flick about a deranged inbred hick mowing people down with his make-shift monster truck ?  I went in expecting a cross between Road Trip and The Hills Have Eyes and got so much more . This was a horror comedy that actually worked . The film makers got it right when it came to making you squirm and making you howl with laughter at the same time . Kudos to Michael Davis for going all out with the gore and pushing the envelope with the sickass humor . Let me list just a few reasons why I love this movie so much :  First off is the story . It's been done to death in so many other flicks . A college guy gets wind that his childhood crush is getting married . He ,  being the 25 year old virgin that he is ,  hops in his Vista Cruiser and decides to take the road trip to confess his love ,  hoping that she will fall head over hills and all that good jive . Hidden in the backseat of his station wagon ,  is good buddy Harley . Harley is the loudmouth ,  former friend ,  who laughs and talks just like Jack Black in High Fidelity . You can't help but like the guy ,  but if he was your friend in real life ,  you'd have to keep a whiffle ball bat handy ( laugh all you want ,  but have you ever been hit with one ?  )  to keep him in check . So ,  he's a little on the obnoxious side ,  to say the least ,  but you can tell that he's a loyal friend ,  deep down...Anyway ,  they're on the road and when they stop in a bar ,  they aggravate the locals . Now they're being stalked by a leatherface clone in a monster truck . That's it . Yeah ,  along the way they pick up a gorgeous hitchhiker but I'm too lazy and hungover to go into that right now ... so just watch the damn movie .  Second thing I love was the humor . This one had some of the sickest laughs of any movie since Cabin Fever . Just how messed up is it ?  Well ,  I won't even go into the whole cat scene and as for the  " corpse burrito "  thing ,  I'll leave that to your virgin eyes as well . The bar full of amputees was somewhat disturbing and that guy who looked like John Turturro bothered me too . Harley ,  although a totally obnoxious frat-boy type ,  can really sling off the one liners . Love the clogs ,  by the way . I need a new pair ...  The GORE . This one pours it on heavy . While the first hour plays out as a demented road comedy ,  the last third is all about blood and guts . If the movie hadn't kept such a light tone throughout ,  it would have been a little disturbing ,  but seeing how it was all played for laughs ,  there is no way possible that you will be bothered by it . If you're still in your seat by the time it comes ,  you'll probably see the humor in it too ,  but seriously ,  there were buckets and buckets of the red stuff . There was a big plot turn that I DIDN'T see coming and when the credits rolled ,  I was completely satisfied . I had gotten exactly what I came for and I'm really glad that I bought it . Much like Cabin Fever ,  it's going to get a lot of replay .  The Look of the movie was outstanding . There was this deliberately cheap look that made the whole thing scream late 80s and I loved the exaggerated colors . It's obvious that Monster Man was done on a relatively low budget ,  but much like Cabin Fever  ( sorry I keep comparing the two )  it actually works in the movie's favor . Cabin Fever was an ode to the 70s greats ,  this was the 80s answer to that . So take that for what it's worth . No CGI here . This is what we all needed . I'm not exactly sure why it didn't get a theatrical release because this is everything that Jeepers Creepers SHOULD have been . Thank god for Lions Gate.
__label__8	This is a surprisingly great low budget Horror / Comedy ,  it's funny and pretty well made ,  with good performances and a really cool twist ending !  . All the characters are pretty cool ,  and the story while unoriginal is very good ,  plus Eric Jungmann ( Adam )  and Justin Urich ( Harley )  had fantastic chemistry together . One of the funniest moments in the film for me is when Adam is trapped in the bathroom ,  and Harley wakes up to find that monster truck sitting there ,  and decides to take a p*ss in the truck ,  and Aimee Brooks is just plain sexy !  ,  plus this is one of the best low budget Horror films I have seen in a long time . It's very gory ,  but in a comical way ,  and I thought it was very well written as well ,  plus Michael Bailey Smith is fantastic as the Monster Man and had some wicked makeup !  . It's similar to films like Joy Ride ,  Duel ,  Jeepers Creepers ,  etc ,  etc and it has some suspenseful moments here and there ,  plus The gore effects are really well done for the most part . This is a surprisingly great low budget Horror / Comedy ,  it's funny and pretty well made ,  with good performances and a really cool twist ending ,  I highly recommend this one !  . The Direction is very good !  . Michael Davis does a very good !  job here ,  with great camera work ,  good angles , good use of colors ,  and using a great setting ,  plus he kept the film funny and at a very fast pace .  There is a lot of gore !  . We get extremely bloody nose bleeds , gory impaling's ,  bloody stabbings , guy is cut in half by a monster truck ,  human remains in a cooked stew ,  guts all over the place , guys guts fall out , pencil in the eyes , bloody slit throat , bunch of people walking around without limbs , gory dead squirrel , heads are squished , severed limbs , bloody and mangled corpses , decent amount of bloodshed , one very gory scene at the very end and more !  .  The Acting is very good for a low budget film . Eric Jungmann is fantastic here as Adam ,  he was a nerd but a very likable one ,  he had fantastic chemistry with Justin Urich ,  had some cool lines , and I just loved his character ,  he also seemed to be enjoying himself , and he was especially good at the end !  . Justin Urich is excellent as the ass of a Best Friend ,  however I just couldn't help but love him as he was very funny ,  and often stole a lot of the scenes ,  I really dug him !  . Aimee Brooks is gorgeous ,  and did great with what she had to do ,  she had good chemistry with Jungmann and like Jungmann was especially good at the end ,  as I loved her mysterious character . Michael Bailey Smith is wonderful as The Monster Man he was very creepy looking ,  had some awesome makeup ,  and is now one of my favorite slashers !  . Rest of the cast do fine .  Overall I highly recommend this one !  . ***1 / 2 out of 5
__label__7	Two city guys are driving through Hicksville USA when a rusty monster truck suddenly appears and repeatedly attempts to run them off the road.Having picked up a mysterious blonde hitchhiker , they pull up at a truck-stop full of redneck amputees , one of whom warns them of  ' the demon out there' . But they don't listen.Big mistake !  " Monster Man "  by Michael Davis mixes comedy with horror surprisingly well.The film borrows heavily from  " Duel "  ,  " The Blair Witch Project "  ,  " Jeepers Creepers "  and  " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " .The story is pretty silly , but there is enough gore and violence to keep splatter freaks happy.I enjoyed especially the performance of Justin Urich , which offers the film its comedy relief.Still the complete lack of suspense is hard to forgive.Give this one a chance , if you have some time to waste.7 out of 10.Did I mention that Aimee Brooks is sexy ? 
__label__9	Great horror comedy from Michael Davis.Iwas laughing so hard i almost peed !  Great acting from Eric Jungman as the good guy who saves the day  &  great performance by the Jack Black-esquire like performance from Justin Urich . He was just divine in this film . This guy deserves to be a big star . Also , Aimee Brooks was good in the film as well as the girl in danger along with the guys from a killer reminiscent of Jeepers Creepers . The gore to was given in copious amounts  &  i loved it.I just hope they release a not rated version . Great low-budget Horror Comedy . The dead cat in the hotel sex scene is just gruesomely funny !  ***** out of *****
__label__7	In the veins of Jeepers Creepers and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ,  Monster Man surprisingly well-made--though mindless--little horror . Throw in a little buddy-comedy ,  nice gore and intense scare . It's hard no to say that Monster Man is really entertaining . The low budget seem pretty obvious ,  but it doesn't effected the presentation of the movie in general and put more big budget horror movies in shame .  Yes ,  the plot somewhat generic as possible . Pair of friend ,  Adam  ( Eric Jungman ) and Harley  ( Justin Urich )  are driving cross country to interrupt the wedding of a woman Adam has always loved . While Adam is more nerdy type ,  Harley is a self-proclaimed ladies man and very offensive loudmouth . Adding a bonus to the plot ,  then they picked up a sexy hitchhiker ,  Sarah  ( Aimee Brooks )  . Things turn into nightmare when a monster truck with scary face drive stalking them . When dead body starts counting ,  they must do the race against the time before their own life on risk .  The plot is obviously reminiscent of many prior famous horror movies ,  but Michael Davis as the writer and director succeed in keeping the tension . The scare is build well enough ,  where characterization is never be the best ,  but fairly okay . The script also littered with comedies that works for the funny moments and they quite enjoyable rather than annoying and also wait for the twist in the finale . It's hilarious and shocking in the same time ,  which is pretty amusing .  As conclusion ,  Monster Man surprisingly entertaining . It deserves more attention in the big screen . It proves that big budget doesn't make an effective horror movie ,  but skill does !  Something that the director has shown and delivers.
__label__10	I first saw this on Demand . Or on TV . I'm not really sure . But this has got to be my all time favorite movie ever !  I mean ,  this movie has blood ,  gore ,  laughs and chills through out the movie . I recently ordered  " Monster Man "  from Amazon and i've been watching  " Monster Man "  ever since i got it . Trust me ,  you will love this movie .   P.S . The commentary on the DVD is way funny . They also said something about  " Monster Man 2 "  during the commentary . Let's hope they make  " Monster Man 2 "  !  If you have the chance ,  rent the movie or buy it . You will absolutely LOVE it !  This is the best movie that has come out in 2003 .  10 / 10
__label__7	Adam  ( Eric Jungmann )  and obnoxious best friend Harley  ( Justin Urich )  are driving cross country to a wedding . Along the way they pick up sexy hitchhiker Sarah  ( Aimee Brooks )  . Then ,  for no reason ,  a monster truck keeps trying to run them off the road...and maybe kill them . Who is doing this and why ?   Pretty good horror film . Its energetic and full of flashy direction which gets you right into the action . It's also a horror comedy . Most of the humor is infantile and REALLY gross but actually somewhat funny . Also this movie really piles on the gore at times--but that's a GOOD thing !  The acting is OK--Jungmann overplays his nerd role a bit much ;  Urich is stuck with the hopeless role of the foul-mouthed ,  sex-obsessed best friend--but pulls it off ;  Brooks is good too in a limited role .  BUT I could see the  " twist "  ending coming long before it happened and logic totally disappears at the end  ( especially the rescue )  . Still ,  this is a gory ,  sometimes funny and sometimes scary horror movie . I give it a 7.
__label__8	I saw this on Zone horror and fully expected it to be compete crap like most of the films they play  ,  however I was pleasantly surprised . The film revolves around 2 friends and a maniac in a monster truck who is chasing them  ( i know it sounds crap but its actually quite good )   ,  the film is creepy when it intends to be and is laugh out loud funny in parts  ( and not in an unintentional way either ,  it is well paced and is a lot of fun as well as being very gory  ,  there's some very funny black humour thrown in as well . Its not the most original movie but so what . If your after Shakespeare then this is not it  ,  if your after a fun movie then this should be fine
__label__7	While driving in a highway to the wedding of his beloved Betty-Ann ,  Adam  ( Eric Jungmann )  is surprised by his former schoolmate Harley  ( Justin Urich )  on the backseat of his car . Adam has broken off with the inconvenient and moron Harley because of Betty-Ann . Along their road trip ,  Harley makes fun of some rednecks in a bar and later their car is chased by a giant monster truck on the road . After some incidents ,  they give a lift to the hitchhiker Sarah  ( Aimee Brooks )  and sooner the trio is terrorized by a scary monster driving the monster truck .  In spite of having one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen in a horror movie ,  the irritating Harley ,   " Monster Man "  is a surprisingly good trash horror-comedy . The story is a collection of clichés ,  beginning like  " Joy Ride "  or  " Duel "  ;  then it turns to one of the countless rip-offs of  " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre "  ;  there is a surprising twist ,  ending with a hook for a sequel . There are hilarious scenes ,  Aimee Brooks is extremely sexy and this film really entertains . My vote is seven .  Title  ( Brazil )  :   " Monster Man " 
__label__10	If you took a really good jack black movie ,  added a little jeepers creepers ,  and then a dash of joyride with a hint of texas chainsaw massacre and house of a 1000 corpses...you would have MONSTER MAN !  i went into this movie ,  not really expecting much at all ,  but i wound up really enjoying the movie . the whole premise is really cheesy ,  a monster man in a monster truck chases down people ,  but it is so funny that the writer / director doesn't expect you to take it seriously . justin urich is a comic gem and should have a very promising career . he is identical to jack black . the only problem with the film is the unbelievable hero role played by eric jungmann . but overall ,  if you are looking for a really really fun movie that will crack you up until you are rolling in the aisles ,  and at the same time ,  scare the crap out of you...check out this film.
__label__8	This was on Showtime the other night ,  and I figured it was going to be another made-for-video crap fest ,  like  " Earth vs . the Spider "  or any of those other HBO horror shorts . Instead ,  I found a comedy / gore classic . It was legitimately funny ,  and surprisingly ,  the acting was quite good . Even my wife ,  an overall horror-hater ,  agreed and was laughing at parts . In addition ,  the FX were high-quality .  Overall ,  the film felt like a parody of Joy Ride / Jeepers Creepers ,  and the 2 main characters reminded me of the pair from Shaun of the Dead . Definitely worth watching ,  but don't take it seriously .  The End.
__label__8	A beautiful woman ,  a backwoods ,  inbred monster man ,  a super sweet monster truck ,  a road kill zombie brother and 2 friends...one anal retentive ,  overly sensitive nerd and the other a foul mouthed ,  adolescent slob . Throw them all together with a dash of Jeepers Creepers ,  Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Road Trip and you've got Monster Man . A hilarious horror / comedy outing that never sets out to  " say something "  . It's a simple ,  straight forward laugh fest . Unpretentious and well made ,  this horror / comedy is at its heart ,  a buddy flick . This film offered some hilarious and sickening set pieces . I highly recommend this to fright fans looking to be entertained.
__label__7	Well ,  it has to be said that Monster Man is a huge mess of a film ,  but somehow multiple different genres and a clichéd plot come together to make one of the most enjoyable modern horror films I've seen in ages !  The two biggest styles that the film mixes are a  ' Road Trip ' style teenage comedy and a  ' Texas Chainsaw Massacre ' style redneck horror vibe ,  and while one gets in the way of the other quite often ;  director Michael Davis manages to keep things moving thanks to the fact that the constant shift in tone means that we're never quite sure where the film is going to be taken next . Things start out worryingly as we're introduced to two characters ,  both irritating in different ways . Adam is a wussy virgin ,  while Harley is a fat big-mouthed  " A-hole "  . They're both driving across the desert to attend the wedding of some chick they both liked in high school . After a couple of strange events ,  they pick up a hitch-hiker ,  and then find themselves being chased by some maniac in a monster truck for reasons unknown ...  The idea of someone being chased by someone else in a bigger vehicle is hardly original ,  but the way the monster truck is used here is one of the film's biggest assets . The truck itself looks spooky because it's so haggard and rusty ,  and the fact that it bounces around the screen makes the unfolding action exciting and suspenseful . After a while ,  you begin to get used to the characters and once Aimee Brooks enters the fray ,  things start to look up . The teen comedy side of the movie actually works pretty well ,  as Justin Ulrich is always on hand to deliver some entertaining lines of dialogue and the scenes between the dorky virgin and the hot female hitch-hiker are interesting enough . Just when you think the film couldn't possibly get any messier ,  things take a turn for the weird in the final third . Without spoiling things ,  it has to be said that Monster Man features the sort of ending that couldn't possibly be seen coming ,  and along with the twist ,  is a big surprise . Some people may feel ripped off by the sudden turn at the end - but I actually thought it worked quite well as it fits the film in that nothing here really fits ... Overall ,  this isn't a  ' great ' film by any means - but if you're looking for some silly entertainment ,  Monster Man should hit the spot ! 
__label__8	Before watching this movie from beginning to end ,  I happened to just catch the last half hour . Ordinarily I don't watch a movie if I haven't seen it from the beginning ,  but a friend had it on and once I started watching it I couldn't stop .  I'm really surprised this movie didn't get a wide theatrical release . This is quite a funny movie  ( often gallows humor )   ,  and the monster and monster truck in it are quite menacing . The monster makes Leatherface look pretty ,  and the monster truck is a like a cross between a World War I German artillery vehicle and a giant coffin .  A timid twenty-five year-old virgin guy is on a long drive to stop the woman he loves from getting married . His ex-best friend tags along and rags on him constantly . They're menaced on the road by a vintage black hearse and the aforementioned monster truck . They also pick up a hitchhiker ,  played by the very sexy Aimee Brooks .  I also watched the animated trailer with the director's commentary ,  and the electronic press kit and I found those both to be interesting . I would bet that the feature commentary with the director and the two male stars is pretty enjoyable too ,  but I have so many other movies to watch I've never seen before....
__label__8	 " Gaming ?  Nicotine ?  Fisticuffs ?  We're moving in a descending spiral of iniquity !  "  So says the head of St . Swithen's upon inspecting the master's common at Nutbourne . The faculty and students of St . Swithen's have been ordered to share facilities at Nutbourne to avoid German bombs during World War II . Then there's the masters ' library .  " The Diary of Samuel Pepys ?  Abridged...well ,  that's something to be thankful for . What's up here ?  The Memoirs of Casanova ?  Wasn't that the book we caught Jessica James reading in the closet ?  Decameron Nights !  Well ,  really !  What ever else this place may or may not be ,  it's no place to bring carefully nurtured girls !  "    Yes ,  a terrible mistake has been made by the Ministry of Education . Nutbourne is a school for boys . St . Swithen's is a school for girls . And what makes this one of the best post-WWII British comedies ,  Nutbourne's head master is Wetherby Pond...played by Alastair Sim ,  while St . Swithen's head mistress is Muriel Whitchurch...played by Margaret Rutherford .    " St . Swithen's ?  "  says Pond .  " You don't mean to say that yours is a school for boys and girls ?  "  he asks one of the early girls .  " Only girls "  she says cheerfully .  " Does this mean ,  sir ,  "  asks one of Nutbourne's teachers ,   " that we are to expect 100 young girls ?  "   " It means that not only have the ministry made a mistake in sending a school here at all ,  but that it is guilty of an appalling sexual aberration !  "    Margaret Rutherford's Miss Whitchurch ,  as positive and immovable as a battleship ,  intends to make the best of it ,  by briskly taking over Nutbourne if possible . Alastair Sim's Pond is exasperated up to his big bald head and is determined to salvage his school . In the meantime ,  there are 100 young girls and 170 young boys to be fed and places found for them to sleep  ( along with all their teachers )  . The cooks and caretakers ,  totally put upon ,  walk out . Miss Whitchurch and her girls ,  however ,  are up to the cooking tasks .  " Come now ,  Angela ,  "  she says to one girl who is trying to stir something in a big pot ,   " haven't you made porridge before ?  "   " Yes ,  but no one ever had to eat it . "   " That's a defeatist attitude ,  my dear . Stir it well and don't shilly shally . "    Things are hardly going well when Pond discovers four governors from a school he hopes to lead are arriving at any moment to see for themselves how well led Nutbourne is . And Miss Whitchurch learns that four wealthy and influential parents have just arrived to see how their daughters are doing in the new -- boy free ,  they were told -- facilities . The only solution ?  Miss Whitchurch and Pond ,  their teachers and their students ,  concoct a split-second shifting of classes to give the allusion that Nutbourne has no girls and that St . Swithen's has no boys . After the parents inspect a dorm and leave for a class ,  the girls in the beds duck under and the boys who'd been hidden under leap up into the beds ,  just as the governors walk in . The boys are observed at rugby and ,  as soon as the governors turn their backs ,  the goal posts are taken down ,  nets for lacrosse are put up ,  and just then the parents walk over to observes the girls . One parent spots her daughter in a science class ,  then moments later sees her in a choir practice ,  then moments later ...  " There's Angela again ,  "  she says to Miss Whitchurch .  " Why so it is ,  "  she replies ,  hustling the parents out to avoid the governors who are approaching just around the corner .  " The child's quite ubiquitous . "    When we leave Nutbourne ,  everything has been discovered . The students are milling about . The teachers are dazed  ( except for two who are kissing . )  The Education Ministry has just sent several more busloads of students . The parents are speechless but the governors are not .  " We're waiting for an explanation ,  "  one says sharply . Pond holds his head and shudders .  " Can't you see I'm trying to think of one . "    The film moves from one complicated and ridiculous situation after another ,  braced by a very funny script and two hugely comedic performances by Rutherford and Sim . Sim's droll exasperation and Rutherford's implacable determination are so well matched that's it's a shame this is the only movie they ever made together . Joyce Grenfell ,  as Gossage ,  St . Swithen's tall ,  awkward ,  loping sports teacher gives them some competition . If you keep your eyes open ,  you'll also find some amusing references director Frank Launder works in ,  including a gong at Nutbourne that looks just like a midget version of J . Arthur Rank's ,  a faint echo of the zither theme from The Third Man and a shot stolen from David Lean's Oliver Twist ,  except this time the little boy walks up holding his porridge bowl and says ,   " Please ,  sir . I don't want anymore . "    Frank Launder and his partner ,  Sidney Gilliat ,  were responsible for some of the best films produced in Britain during the Thirties ,  Forties and Fifties . They wrote ,  produced and directed ,  sometimes doing one ,  sometimes the other . In one way or another they were responsible for such first-rate films as Green for Danger  ( with a masterly droll performance by Sim )  ,  I See a Dark Stranger ,  The Lady Vanishes ,  Night Train to Munich ,  Wee Geordie ,  The Belles of St . Trinian's ,  The Rake's Progress and many others . With The Happiest Days of Your Life ,  Launder wrote and directed while both produced . It's one of their best.
__label__8	This film is just plain lovely . It's funny as hell and as old as the hills . The acting is superb and it's fascinating seeing post-war Britain and how we used to behave in those days . This seems to have been some pre-runner to the St . Trinians films  ( given the Alastair Sim and Margaret Rutherford connection - there's also a very young George Cole in there who appeared in many St . Trinians films )  but I don't myself understand the connection . It was shown on BBC4 recently after a biography of St . Trinians creator Ronald Searle ,  however I missed enough of the biography to miss the connection with this film . Anyway a great film in its own right and something that should be preserved for all time ! 
__label__10	This film was made thirteen years before I was born but I still think it is the wittiest ,  dottiest ,  most harmless piece of fun ever made . It simply could not go wrong with the cast of superb British character actors it boasts .  Where to start ?  Alastair Sim-peerless ;  Margaret Rutherford-ditto ; the wonderfully alkward ,  innocent Gossage ,  played to perfection by the imperious Joyce Grenfell . The caddish Victor Hyde-Brown  ( a Guy Middleton special )  and the rest of the staff sum up post-war middle-class England to a tee .  The humour is sometimes obvious ,  but it is of that special  " Ealing "  variety and is never offensive .  I have watched this film more times than I care to remember and still laugh like a drain at the antics every time . The storming of the dorms occupied by the girls school ,  the magnificently-planned but ultimately doomed twin tours of the school and the chaotic ending involving the arrival of a third school to add to the anarchy ,  are priceless .  It's an old cliché I know ,  but they really do not make them like that anymore . How I wish they did . If you haven't seen it ,  please do ,  you won't be disappointed.
__label__8	A bumbling error at the Ministry Of Education results in Nutbourne Boys School having to share with St Swithin's School For Girls . This bemuses the respective head teachers of each school and leads to all manner of chaotic goings on ,  however the two are forced to come to an uneasy alliance in the hope of averting major trouble .  The Happiest Days Of Your Life is based on the John Dighton play from 1948 ,  with Dighton writing the part of Headmistress Whitchurch specifically for Margaret Rutherford . Replacing George Howe from the play in the role of Headmaster Pond ,  is Alastair Sim ,  and here in lies the crowning glory of this filmic adaptation ,  Sim  &  Rutherford are perfectly wonderful ,  bouncing off each other to keep what is basically a one joke movie ,  highly entertaining . Directed by the gifted Frank Launder ,  and produced by the equally adroit Sidney Gilliat ,  The Happiest Days Of Your Life is a quintessentially British movie ,  obviously a precursor to the St Trinians franchise ,  the film entertains the children with it's high jinks clash of the sexes heart ,  whilst tickling the watching adults with its very saucy undercurrent . Thankfully the chaotic ending cements all that has gone before it to leave this particular viewer with a grin as wide as Nutbourne Rail Station ,  great fun 8 / 10.
__label__10	After a long run in the West End this charming film re-cast Margaret Rutherford as the Headmistress  ' Miss Whitchurch ' in this financially successful adaptation made in 1950 .  All interior shots took place at Riverside studios in Hammersmith ,  London . The exterior scenes were filmed on location at a public girl's school near Liss in Hampshire . During the 12 - week shoot both Margaret Rutherford and Joyce Grenfell were staying in a hotel nearby and would often visit the school during the evenings where they would happily enjoy the company of the real school mistresses .  Although the film's script contains only two original lines from the original play the leads and supporting actors are in fine form and you can only feel sympathetic for their predicament especially in the final scenes.
__label__8	The play is cleverly constructed - begin with the porter ,  Rainbow -  &  let the audience see the background unfold through his eyes . The film follows the play with great faithfulness ,  working ,  no doubt ,  on the simple premise that it couldn't be bettered . Now throw in a host of superb character actors -  &  the result is a resounding triumph.A definite must-see.
__label__7	The Happiest Days of Your Life showcases some of Britain's greatest comedy talents of its time in a traditionally farcical and upper-class-twit like fashion . Generally it is a whistle-stop tour of stuffy English behaviour with the girls-only school providing a great setting for the dotty goings-on . Margaret Rutherford ,  Alastair Sim and - most especially !  - Joyce Grenfell are all fantastic ,  giving us a lot of laughs as they express their utter horror at what they are having to deal with . As the film moves on ,  things get sillier and sillier with the tour around the school for the parents being a suitably crackers high point .  At this point I will give special mention ,  again ,  to Joyce Grenfell and her wonderful character Miss Gossage . She is so extraordinarily innocent ,  silly ,  apologetic and ineffectual that she seems to steal the whole film . She provides the greatest laugh of the film when she flirts with a male teacher  (  " Call me sausage !  "  )  .  Whilst some of the film is slow or dated ,  and not always very involving ,  it still maintains most of its sparkle and barely pauses for romance . Good for a silly ,  harmless giggle .  7 / 10
__label__9	This film ,  without doubt ,  is the clearest example of the British humour the Germans can't understand . One-liners run rampant in a film spawning one of the greatest series of films in British cinema history  ( St.Trinians )  . The story of bureaucratic incompetence amid post-war trials enables Frank Launder to direct maximum talent from all the cast . It's probably the only film in which Margaret Rutherford meets her match ,  in Alastair Sim ,  for forceful characterisation  ( she still wins though )  . Joyce Grenfell  ( bless her )  and Richard Wattis both deserve mentions in Dighton's masterpiece of English etiquette and stiff upper lip under pressure .  No Rutherford / Sim / Grenfell fan would be without this in their collection . Absolutely brilliant . Why 9 / 10 ?  Only 83mins long.
__label__10	One of the flat-out drollest movies of all-time . Sim and Rutherford are at their best matching wits over the predicament of an all-boys and all-girls school sharing the same quarters . Slapstick has never been this sophisticated.
__label__10	From the golden period of British films ,  this has my vote for one of the funniest of all time . Screened yesterday at my Film Society to a rapturous audience ,  I was astonished at how well the comedy has lasted  ( made in 1950 !  )  . It is really down to the expert timing and inimitable playing from two of the finest actors Britain has produced :  Margaret Rutherford and Alastair Sim . Adapted from a play by John Dighton ,  this farce is briskly handled by director Frank Launder . The plot is simple :  A ministry mistake billets a girls ' school on a boys ' school . I will always laugh when I think of this film.
__label__10	I can't remember exactly where i heard of them first ,  but i listen to a little of one song and liked it . Went and bought the cd and had finally found the type of music i like . I heard about this video and knew i had to have it . It has a lot of clips from them playing in concert . Let me tell you ,  watching this video doesn't even compare to them in concert . I've seen them twice in concert and don't want to ever miss a chance to see them again . The other two things it has is some interview ,  and even a video for one of their biggest songs . couple little side notes...i saw them at ozzfest 2001 and they ruled there ,  but seeing them in a smaller inside stage was much better  ( they had some really cool things to do with being able to cut out the lights )  the other ,  in case anyone wonders ,  votary means a devout follower.
__label__10	Slipknot is a heavy metal band from the great city of Des Moines ,  Iowa in which the rockers wear their own distinguished mask  ( I know someone already said this ,  but I need to fill up space for this review )  . The band members are Joey ,  Mick ,  133 ,  Sid ,  Clown ,  James ,  Corey ,  Chris ,  and Paul . This band is one of the best new heavy metal bands in my opinion and should be heard by everyone that loves hardcore rock . Another good movie is called  " DISASTERPIECES "  which shows the band's performance at the London Arena . The  " My Plague "  video was shot there and is included on the DVD . The most kick ass song they made is also on there  ( Sic )  . So if you love the band you need to see this and if you love heavy metal music then you have to hear this band.
__label__9	I did it too . When i first saw the band ,  i dismissed them straight away without even listening to the music . Then one day ,  out of sheer curiosity ,  i bought the cd and fell in love with it . So i bought the video . hold onto your lunch kids ,  this isnt going to be pretty !  the video was excellent - a great opportunity to hear the music ,  see some of the promo videos ,  and meet the band...although i *still* dont know how they can cope with wearing those masks all the time !  a must for all fans of the band ,  and fans of alternative music in general
__label__7	This DVD usually sells for around  $ 20 . I wouldn't pay this much for the DVD if I had known what I was getting ,  but regardless this is a pretty good disc . It displays the Knot in all their glory ,  with footage from their concerts ... playing Surfacing ,  Wait and Bleed and Scissors among other tracks ,  including the  " Spit it Out "  music video ,  which was apparently banned from MTV .  Slipknot ,  for those who don't know ,  is essentially a symphony of the damned :  nine masked men who display total chaos on stage ,  with machine gun drums ,  squealing guitar and vocals that will tear your face off and leave you wanting more . For those who've never seen Slipknot before ,  I cannot recommend enough you get this DVD ... probably off eBay or Amazon so you can get a better deal .  A short ,  though well made show of the Knot .  Seven out of ten.
__label__10	Slipknot is a hardcore rock band from Des Moines ,  Iowa . Nine band members who all wear customized boilersuits ,  and personalized ,  homemade masks  ( eg .  # 6's clown mask ,   # 0's various gasmasks ,   # 8's tattered  +  torn crashtest dummie mask with dreadlocks )  . The music itself seems to walk the finelines between sane and otherwise ,  yet is performed so brilliantly and psychotic .   " Welcome To Our Neighborhood "  sounds rather a generic title ,  but the footage itself is something else . Interviews with the band ,  soundbites from their latest ,  selftitled album ,  2 live performances ,  and one banned-by-MTV music video  ( a brilliant homage to the classic Kubrick film  " The Shining "  )  ,  the movie clocks in at not even half-an-hour ,  but is certainly worth it . It is perfect for introducing any metal / hardcore fan to Slipknot.
__label__8	This is one of the most enjoyable teen movies I have ever seen  ( and that I wished was released to video )  . It was released the same year as another great comedy in which Tim Matheson played a role  " Animal House "   ( Which is probably why it was overlooked )  .   One of the most memorable parts of this film would definitely be the soundtrack ,  which could have and should have been a formal label release . The soundtrack features a lesser-known 70's act named High Inergy whose song  " We are the future "  ,  played a marquee role in the movie's Prom scene . I remember purchasing the group's album  " Steppin ' Out "  as a kid mainly because of the look of the girls and not necessarily for their musical talents .   The closing song is one of the best ballads I have ever heard ,  and I can still hear it in my head . I wish I knew the group's name so that I could look for it somewhere in cyberspace .  If you liked films such as  " Over the edge "  and  " Rich Kids "  ,  I think this is one that you will enjoy as well.
__label__7	I remember seeing this film in the theater in 1984 when I was 6 years-old  ( you do the math )  . I absolutely loved it . I was Tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it  ( climbing the furniture ,  jumping around making monkey sounds )  . It started a fascination with Tarzan and monkeys ,  but oddly enough a longer lasting love for Christopher Lambert  ( keep in mind that I saw Highlander very shortly after this )  . 1984 was the last time I saw that film ,  until about a month ago . It happened to be on cable as I was getting ready for bed at 3 : 30 am and even though it was late and I was tired and I had to be at work at 9 : 00 am ,  I stayed up to watch this movie that I loved as a kid .   Upon viewing it I realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that ,  that Andie MacDowell's voice was dubbed by someone else . Ian Holme was of course solid as usual ,  and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up ,  but what was most surprising was how good Lambert was as Tarzan . He was great !  The depth he managed to capture in so few lines ,  his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark ,  were just amazing .  As I stated earlier I am Lambert fan ,  but I'm used to Highlander ,  The Hunted and Fortress . In this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again .  So to make a short story way too long ,  I was a little disappointed that the film was not that good ,  but I was glad to see that Lambert was good and I do not regret staying up until 6 : 00am to see it.
__label__10	How his charter evolved as both man and ape was outstanding . Not to mention the scenery of the film . Christopher lambert was astonishing as lord of Greystoke . Christopher is the soul to this masterpiece . I became so enthrawled with his performance i could feel my heart pounding . The entireity of the movie still moves me to this day . His portrayal of John was Oscar worthy ;  as he should have been nominated for it.
__label__8	Although films about Edgar Rice Burroughs famous Rousseauian hero Tarzan have been seen by movie goers for almost a century now ,  this is the definitive version of the story . Greystoke is the actual story of the origins of Tarzan as set down by Edgar Rice Burroughs way back in the second decade of the last century . I've been assured by experts .  Tarzan and Sherlock Holmes are probably the most filmed fictional heroes in history . I've no basis in fact for saying that ,  just a gut feeling . The most popular Holmes was Basil Rathbone ,  the most popular Tarzan was Johnny Weissmuller . And films that they made with both those characters will be criticized no end by purists .  But Greystoke is the real deal ,  a faithful adaption of Burroughs first story concerning the origin of his hero . I can't think of another film which shows that Tarzan learned French before English ,  but that is shown here and it's only natural since it was a French survivor of a massacred safari played by Ian Holm who discovers Tarzan who has been raised by the apes since his parents who were shipwrecked on the African coast died there after his mother gave birth .  His parents were in fact the son and daughter-in-law of the Earl of Greystoke and the surviving Earl ,  played by Ralph Richardson is of course overjoyed to learn he has a grandson . Of course there are others who don't welcome the new heir back in society .   One who doesn't is Andie McDowell playing of course Jane . She does not communicate with Tarzan in answer to his grunts and monosyllabic commands . Tarzan speaks a concise English ,  French ,  and understands the language of the apes as well . As for the language of love ,  Tarzan and Jane need no lessons .  Greystoke earned three Oscar nominations for best makeup in regard to the apes ,  best adapted screenplay and a posthumous nomination for Ralph Richardson for Best Supporting Actor . It should also have rated a nomination for cinematography of the jungle scenes in Cameroun and the scenes of the British Aristocracy in several landmark places like Hatfield House and Blenheim Palace .  For Burroughs purists ,  Greystoke is the real deal.
__label__10	I have seen most of the Tarzan episodes . Certainly the rated X with O'Keeffe  &  Bo Derek ,  which is totally deplorable .  I have seen this version several times since it was originally shown .  All the cast had memorable parts ,  great acting the Ape sequences .  Last night I viewed same on Spanish station and other than some French dialog all in Spanish .  As far as Hudson not wanting Andie's voice he did nothing until the very end . He viewed the dailies and could have hired a dialog coach .  It seems silly that a story about apes and a man raised by them all speaking gibberish that Hudson attacked Andie.The story line in the movie was that she was an American cousin . The last time I checked Carolina was in the USA .  She was beautiful in movie and her eyes ,  and gorgeous hair ,  alabaster skin mystified all us males . She did not have to resort to Bo's level .  She has remained a LADY throughout the rest of her career and should look at this movie  ( half her life ago )  , as a starting point . Her performance ,  sincerity ,  made this movie enjoyable ,  believable that a half wild man could ascertain her inner beauty .  Great sending point for Sir Richardson ,  he did steal the movie.

__label__10	Watch it with an open mind ,  it is very different ,  nothing's cutesy about this . Very well done realistic tale of Tarzan . The animatronics chimpazees are well done for  ' 84 ,  Christopher Lambert was brilliant imitating chimpazee language and behavior . I wouldn't be surprised if he took lessons from Jane Goodall.
__label__8	While it comes no closer to the Tarzan of Edgar Rice Burroughs than ,  say ,  the Johnny Wiesmuller flicks did it does have it's own peculiar ,  and entertaining ,  slant on the story . Its a well done Tarzan movie . Nice scenery ,  good photography ,  workable continuity ,  and a Tarzan yell that echos the one described by Burroughs . The players all perform well . The only bad points I found were ,  I think ,  related . It moves slow in places . That slow movement ?  Makes this picture to long . It could easily have been 15 to 20 minutes shorter ,  which I think would have helped with the natural flow of the plot line and the character development . But the rest of the film works well enough to carry it over these two rough spots and still leave the viewer satisfied with the flick . Short version of all the above  ... Its a very GOOD Tarzan movie.
__label__8	I thought this was a very daring representation of the old hokey  ' Tarzan ' concept made so popular by Hollywood ,  Weismuller ,  et al .  Yes ;  there is a lot of silly stuff . But then ,  the idea is silly . It is almost unbelievable that a human baby could be sired to adulthood by chimpanzees . I am tempted to say completely unbelievable ,  but that the concept has never been tried . And there is certainly a bit too much anthropomorphism for comfort . Though under the circumstances I can see how that would be very difficult to avoid . We also now have a much greater insight into the issues of acculturation ,  and know that a human raised from infancy without human behavioural prompts would ultimately never learn them in adulthood .  Still ,  if you can get your head around that lot ,  there's a great deal to admire that is both imaginative and daring . Lambert does the beast thing with tremendous aplomb . I am tempted to say that it is the most convincing and sympathetic role I have seen him play . There are plenty of other excellent performances too . Not least of which are Sir Ralph Richardson and Ian Holm .  What is particularly disturbing - and rightly so - is the simian perception of humans . We get to see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor ,  dumb ,  helpless brutes over whom we so routinely lord it . And it demonstrates well how the phony  ' civilisation ' and  ' morality ' with which we cloak and justify our conduct ,  is no more than an expression of own selfishness and arrogance . It may seem a little overstated at times ,  especially in the hideous museum dissection rooms ,  but what we see isn't just a truth about the Victorians ;  its a truth about the way we are today . It's one that needs to be stated ,  and cannot be stated often enough . Holm's character's obsession with the  ' ray-zor ' as a symptom of civilisation - as if to possess facial hair were a primitive condition to be scorned - is an excellent case in point . Primitive bearded readers take note .  The story is depressing . Ultimately it's a tragedy . Because even though he returns to the jungle and the freedom from moral tyranny that is truly human  ' civilisation ' ;  we know he's doomed . Before the third millennium is 50 years old ,  wild simians will be hunted into extinction as bush meat ,  and their environment developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation to gratify insatiable human excess .  In the end ,  it's a tale about ourselves . The path to extinction that other simians tread ,  must eventually be followed by humans .  Highly recommended for its ethical take ,  despite the hokey moments.
__label__10	Before I review this film ,  I must make a confession that is rather a bold statement to make as a film reviewer . Anyone who has already read any of my previous reviews may know that I've always been controversial in a low-key sense ,  giving high marks for flops such as  " Captain America "  and 1985's  " Creature "  and panning such film classics as Alistar Sim's  " A Christmas Carol "  and  " Shakespeare in Love . "  With that in mind ,  this confession might not come as a surprise :   The simple fact is ,  Christopher Lambert is probably one of my favorite actors . Woah ,  now ,  don't start getting crazy on me just yet . Let me explain myself :  I by no means think he's the greatest actor in the world . I clearly confess that he is not . He is certainly no Morgan Freeman or Anthony Hopkins ,  but I would say that his acting ability is probably somewhere up there with at least Bruce Willis . What I admire about him ,  however ,  are the human qualities that he brings into his action heroes . He is just an average guy who laughs and cries and bleeds ,  who is a hero because he has to be ,  not necessarily because he wants to be . It takes a lot ,  in my opinion ,  to be able to bring out those qualities in a character  ( especially in the movies he's worked in )  ,  and Lambert's heroes are a far cry from Schwartzennegger's or Stallone's . Quite frankly ,  Lambert's characters are easier for me to relate to . Hence ,  he's not the greatest actor in the world....He's just a personal favorite .  I can't say that same ,  however ,  for his films . However much I appretiate his acting ,  it would be foolish not to confess that his choice of films leave something to be desired . Most of them are ,  quite frankly ,  terrible ,  and any ridicule that he's gotten over the years from me isn't due to his acting ,  but rather his bad choice in scripts .  With that in mind ,  I can say that his debut film ,   " Tarzan ,  "  is one of his best films and probably his greatest performance . As I mentioned ,  it is effective becasue of the humaness he brings to the role ,  and for how seriously the director ,  writers and actors handle the material . This is a far leap from the B-movie action adventures with Johnny Weismeller from the 1940's . In fact ,  I would hesitate to call it an action movie . Instead ,  it is a serious drama that takes all of E.R . Burrough's material seriously ,  showing Tarzan's quest to discover his real family in Scotland after realizing that he doesn't fit in as a  " white ape . "  He is torn in between his old family and his new one ,  which includes a wonderful Sir Ralph Richardson in his final role . In an attempt to adapt to humans ,  his ape instincts also kick in ,  and he can't decide what he loves more :  His real family ,  or the one that he's always known . All in all ,  it is a wonderful commentary on society ,  and a wonderful character study .  If nothing else ,  it launched Lambert into international stardom ,  which continued will into the 1980's with films like  " Highlander "  and  " he Sicilian . "  Unfortunately ,  it didn't last . But just wait a while....His latest career moves such as  " Gideon "  and  " Resurrection "  have proven that though he still have a long way to go ,  he's a competent enough actor to be able to perhaps make a ... ahem ... comeback if he'll just pick his roles better .  For now ,  however ,  here's the verdict on his first film :   *** out of ****
__label__10	The greatest Tarzan ever made !  This movie is done in a way that no other Tarzan ever has come close in doing . It has every thing in it that you would want in a Tarzan movie . No other Tarzan movie ever has or ever will portray the character this well . I would say that if you have seen a Tarzan movie and liked it you should see this one you will love it ,  and if you have never seen Tarzan you should see this one and forget the rest of them.
__label__8	I must confess that I don't remember this film very well . But ,  certainly I liked it . I think it was the best adaptation from Burroughs novel ,  really . And of course it's one of the best movie from Christopher Lambert .  A good movie about Tarzan ,  as cult as the ones with Weissmuller.
__label__8	Don't let the wildly varying reviews of the movie deter you . You'll love it or hate it according to your own tastes . However ,  if for no other reason ,  see  " Greystoke "  to experience the excitement of a great actor grabbing your heart as he breathes life into his role . Ralph Richardson was not a great actor for how perfectly he could handle Shakespeare ;  rather ,  he is to be remembered for his sensitive treatment of every character he portrayed . He was never indifferent to his responsibility as an actor . His reading of the part of the Sixth Lord of Greystoke ,  his last performance ,  is to be cherished by all who love the theatre.
__label__9	Where this movie is faithful to Burroughs ' vision ,  it is excellent ;  where it departs from Burroughs ,  it is superb . It is a tale of family ,  of the seeking of a father by a real and emotional orphan . Lambert's speaking of one of the most anguished lines in all of cinema  " He was my Father !  "  is enough to bring tears to the eyes of the most cynical critic . Not a perfect motion picture - the notorious over-dubbing of McDowell's voice by Glenn Close is unconscionable and only explicable in terms of a very British error - but a fine if flawed masterpiece and a noble farewell to Sir Ralph Richardson.
__label__10	There is absolutely no doubt that this version of Tarzan is the closest to Burroughs ' vision . While he gladly collected his royalties from the films produced during his lifetime ,  he frequently made it clear that they were little more than the bastard children of his tales . The film studios ' ludicrous obsession with casting Olympic swimmers as Tarzan was beyond laughable . I guess we should consider ourselves lucky that they did not set their sights on shot-putters .   Prior to this film ,  the most faithful adaptations were in comic strips and comic books . As fine as some of these were ,  we had to wait seven decades for a filmmaker with the integrity to respect the character as he had been created.
__label__8	This is both an entertaining and a touching version of the classic tale ,  also quite intelligent ,  not of the  ' Me Tarzan ,  You Jane ' school at all .  It's the famous story of a child reared to manhood in the jungle by apes . A titled British couple  ( the wife pregnant )  is stranded in the African wilds after a shipwreck . After the parents ' deaths ,  the baby is raised in the jungle by apes . Twenty years later ,  this young man  ( i.e . Tarzan )  rescues a wounded Belgian explorer ,  nursing him back to health . The Belgian discovers evidence that his rescuer is the young Lord Greystoke and returns him to his rightful estate in Scotland ,  where he must adjust to civilized society .   The movie is sort of divided into two parts . In the first half ,  we see Tarzan in his jungle environment . Not being an expert ,  I am unaware as to the realism of its depiction of ape community life ,  but it is certainly entertaining . For me ,  the more moving section is the second half ,  when Tarzan must meet his real family ,  develop language skills ,  and adjust to aristocratic British society ,  all the while wooing Jane  ( Andie MacDowell )  . He is portrayed as a  ' noble savage ' ,  whether in the wild or in elegant Edwardian parlors . By contrast ,  the upper crust is depicted as often far more barbaric than the jungle Tarzan left .  Christopher Lambert is fantastic in his sympathetic portrayal of Tarzan in both the jungle and civilized environments . He conveys a real sense of his confusion and conflict ,  torn as he is between the two very different worlds ,  his original ape family and his new human one . Sir Ralph Richardson ,  one of the old British legends ,  is brilliant as always in the role of Tarzan's grandfather ,  the Sixth Earl of Greystoke .   The film focuses more on Tarzan's struggles in adapting to civilization and his inner conflict than on his jungle exploits . This unusual take on the old classic makes it both the typical dramatic adventure but also ,  above all ,  a moving personal story . I wasn't surprised to note here that its director is the same individual ,  Hugh Hudson ,  who also directed Chariots of Fire ,  another brilliant movie.
__label__10	..especially by Lambert . This is the essential Burrough's Tarzan that I grew up reading when I was a kid . I have read a few negative reviews on this film and couldn't help but wonder what their issue was . They obviously didn't see the movie I did or they were expecting something that was more akin to the Saturday afternoon serials .  This was the Tarzan that was of the novel and the film makers should be applauded for tackling the source material and taking it seriously . Lambert was excellent . I still think he is one of Hollywood's most under-rated actors . This was a movie that he shines in .  The photography and the apes ,  done by Rick Baker both were amazing . You definitely felt the since of the jungle . The 2nd half ,  Tarzan's attempt at being civilized really pulls you into the emotional conflict he had was forced to resolve .  I highly recommend this film
__label__10	I don't understand why it is so underrated on IMDb ... This movie is just the perfection ... The better adaptation of all times of the myth of Tarzan !  As a french ,  I can say that this is the better role of Christophe Lambert ,  ridiculous in a lots of movies ,  but here absolutely wonderful ,  charismatic ,  incredible !  The plot is great ,  well told ,  the story magnificent ,  the direction ,  the atmosphere ,  the music ,  every things are perfect !  How believe these sequences with the Elgar music ,  just simply perfect ...  Greystoke is truly an unbelievable movie ,  underrated here ,  I don't really know why ,  but really appreciated
__label__10	Beautifully filmed ,  acclaimed director Hugh Hudson  ( Chariots of Fire )  creates a story that brings the entire legend of John Clayton ,  Lord Greystoke and Tarzan of the apes to life with reverence and dignity ,  and with a scope not heretofore seen in Tarzan films . Christopher Lambert makes his starring debut as the young Lord ,  raised in the wild by a female gorilla after his parents die in Africa . Later returned to what is to him an alien world ,  that of class and privilege ,  he feels totally out of place . Once he learns what has happened to the apes that raised him and their world he realizes that he must go back . A sad but triumphant story told against a background of fantastic vistas . This is one of those films that is a must for every Cinemaphile's collection.
__label__10	Greystoke :  The Legend of Tarzan ,  Lord of the Apes is based on the classic book Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs and is a more faithful adaptation to the classic book ,  the film has some great scenery like the Jungles of South Africa to the Greystoke mansion ,  the acting is also great . Chirstopher Lambert did a great performance as Tarzan ,  it was also his first English speaking role . The film has some funny moments ,  sad moments and touching moments that makes this a real classic .  The film sees a boat crashing in the Jungles of South Africa and some time later they have a son named John ,  the Apes go into the hut and one of them kills the Father . The Apes then take him to where they live and adopt him as one of their own ,  as the years go by John grows up and learns to be more like the Apes . In his teens his Foster Mom gets attacked by Native Hunters and soon killed by them ,  years later a group of people are going to Africa on a expedition . After setting up camp they're soon attacked by the Natives ,  most escape but Capitaine Phillippe D'Arnot is left behind injured by some of the arrows . After hiding he meets John now an adult who takes him to his home and takes care of his wounds ,  after a while Phillippe starts to teach John how to speak English and teach him that he's not one of the Apes but a person . When Phillippe goes to leave John goes with him ,  after sometime they arrive at Greystoke manor where the Sixth Earl of Greystoke is shown his long lost Grandson ,  John is shown his bedroom and picture of his true Mom and Dad . John also meets Jane Porter and slowly as they get to know each other he begins to have feelings for her ,  when it's Christmas the Sixth Earl of Greystoke slides down the stairs killing himself . John then starts to miss the Jungle and wants to return but Phillipe tells him to stay since everything they had done would be for nothing . John is then torn between his life as a Greystoke and the Lord of the Apes .  Greystoke :  The Legend of Tarzan ,  Lord of the Apes is a great classic that should be seen . 10 / 10
__label__7	I really liked the first part of this film in Africa for about an hour or so until the animal cruelty by civilized humans in Scotland got to me in the second half and made me so sad I couldn't watch some of it . However ,  this was done by the filmmaker to make a point that early natural scientists ruined everything alive they didn't understand by  " studying "  it literally to death without considering the rights and comfort of the animals studied ,  which we know now shouldn't be studied anywhere but in the natural world they inhabit ,  and as unobtrusively as possible . I do recommend this film as it was a mostly serious and honest story of Tarzan and made a point of showing the gross animal cruelty that was rampant in the 19th century scientific world as well as the pure and simple ,  beautifully primitive life Tarzan lived as a young man who was found as a baby and raised by chimps after the violent death of his parents in the African jungle .  Christopher Lambert was wonderful and very soulful in his life of Tarzan role ,  as was Ralph Richardson in his last film role as Tarzan's ultra-rich ,  nobility-reeking gramps in Scotland . Andy MacDowell was pretty and pretty good as Tarzan's gussied-up and civilized  " Jane "  in her first movie role . From his charismatic work in this film and his very haunting eyes ,  I cannot understand why Lambert did not later become a big star ,  but his really bad movie choices later may have done him in . The terrific Ian Holm ,  as a wounded Frenchman in Africa helped by Tarzan and who then escorted Tarzan back to his previously unknown ,  ancestral home in Scotland ,  was great as always .  I am so glad Tarzan got sick of and didn't stay in the animal-cruel civilized world at that time and went home to Africa in the end to live out his life with his gentle and loving ape  " relatives "  who raised him instead of staying in Scotland and living like royalty ,  which would have ruined him if it didn't kill him first.
__label__7	This begins a series  ( which I'll hopefully keep up every week-end )  of films that came out during my childhood  in this case ,  it's one I've only managed to catch now . It was clearly intended as the last word on the subject ,  which basically had been debased to the level of hokum over the years ;  however ,  in its uncompromising striving for a serious-minded approach  ( a sure measure of which is that the protagonist is never once referred to by the name he's been known all this time the world over !  )  ,  the film-makers rather lost track of the fact that the thing was intended primarily as entertainment !  Consequently ,  we get a decidedly staid representation of events  with more care given to meticulous period reconstruction than in providing a functional thematic environment for its mythic jungle hero !  Even so ,  Christopher Lambert rose to stardom  as did another debutante ,  Andie McDowell ,  playing his love interest  ( named Jane ,  of course )   with the title role ,  which he handles creditably enough under the circumstances . However ,  Ralph Richardson  ( to whom the film is dedicated ,  this being his swan-song )  steals every scene he's in as Tarzan's natural grandfather who ,  in spite of showing obvious affection for his long-lost kin ,  can't bring himself to forget tradition in an effort to understand his predicament ;  the hero ,  in fact ,  is much more comfortable interacting with primates  ( even contriving ,  after having gone back home ,  to save his adoptive  ' dad ' from captivity )  . The film is otherwise very good to look at  ( with cinematography by Stanley Kubrick regular John Alcott ,  no less )  ,  features an appropriately grandiose score as well as remarkable make-up effects  ( by Rick Baker )   and ,  while essentially disappointing as a Tarzan outing ,  retains considerable value nonetheless as a prestige picture of its day.
__label__8	If you are looking for a modern film version of Buster Crabbe or Johnny Weismuller's overcoming the machinations of unscrupulous ,  white safari guides or cunning ,  black tribesmen ,  while saving the animal kingdom ,  this is NOT the movie for you . This is a recounting of the Tarzan  " legend "  from its beginning in intelligent ,  adult terms . It is beautifully filmed and faithful to the Edgar Rice Burroughs stories .  Tarzan is no action hero ,  but a man torn between two worlds - the natural and the civilized . In a stunning performance ,  Christopher Lambert portrays this angst with absolute realism . If he slips up just once the cat will be out of the bag :  the audience  ( especially the adult audience targeted by the film )  will laugh ,  and the film will completely lose its grip . It will plummet into the cheesy depths . But Lambert never lets that happen .  ( Forget what you may think of him in other movies ;  when I saw this film at the theater on its original release ,  I thought he deserved an academy award . )   The supporting cast is uniformly excellent ,  as other commentators have noted . I disagree with most of them in that I didn't find anything wrong with Andie McDowell's performance . I wouldn't have nominated her for an academy award - the role is undemanding - but she is completely up to it ,  such as it is . I don't know why her voice was overdubbed ,  either .  The cinematography of the African segment of the tale is absolutely beautiful . It captures both the beauty of the African wilderness and the exotic expectation it holds in the collective imagination of those who have never been there . The scenery is lush and exotic ,  and the colors are vivid .  But this is also a  " period "  film ,  and the cinematography also magnificently depicts Victorian England - the countryside ,  the city and the interiors . The costumes are outstanding . The soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming or obtrusive .  There are some disturbing scenes - especially for animal lovers - but no more disturbing than a few scenes in Dances with Wolves . This is an excellent film about the conflict between civilization and nature ,  personified in the young Lord Greystoke ,  convincingly portrayed by Christopher Lambert.
__label__10	Greystoke is without doubt the best tarzan movie I have ever seen . Christopher Lambert portrays a very believable man trying to return to the world of mankind alongside the fantastic Ian Holm . The struggle of John to leave the jungle and the apes who raised him is quite stirring . Some very memorable scenes including where Lambert makes the jungle noises to the romantic interest ,  and the scene where he witnesses his ape father's death . Tarzans feelings for both worlds is well developed and really makes you feel for him .  An excellent and underrated movie.
__label__8	SPOILERS Edgar Rice Burroughs's famous character was adapted thousand of times for the screen til one's thirst is quenched ,  notably during the thirties and the forties by Hollywood . Its productors made Tarzan one of the most successful cinema characters . Several years later ,  Hugh Hudson decided to make a more ambitious version of the monkey-man and it's a more natural ,  more wild and more down-to-earth Tarzan that he gives away here . Hudson skilfully avoids the clichés that you usually grant to Tarzan such as his famous scream or his friendly pet ,  Cheetah . Not only ,  are we far from the designed and invented character made by Hollwood but we are also far from the film set used to make his stories . The movie was partly made in Africa  ( more precisely in Cameroon )  . The movie introduces two obvious parts :  the first one which takes place in the jungle where Tarzan lives among his adoptive friends ,  the apes and considers himself as their lord . But he ignores his real origins . The second one in England where Tarzan discovers the English society . Ian Holm epitomizes the link between the two parts and Hudson avoids all that could make the movie falls into the ridiculous thanks to a clever screenplay . Indeed ,  Holm teaches Lambert basic rules of manners so as to behave correctly in the English society and the result works . Moreover ,  in the second part ,  no-one ever laughs at Tarzan and he's even really appreciated . As far as the end is concerned well it's a both bitter and happy end . Happy because Tarzan comes back to the jungle and meets again his adoptive close relatives . But bitter too ,  because this homecoming means that the Greystoke line won't be ensured and is condemned to disappear ... Christophe Lambert finds here ,  his first  ( and last ?  )  great role . Sadly ,  he'll never equal the achievement of his performance in this movie and he'll play in poor and insipide action movies . Nevertheless ,  as I said previously ,  a clever screenplay ,  a performance of a rare quality ,  some impressive natural sceneries  ( both the jungle and the English country and we get a gorgeous movie . It's also an excellent rereading from a popular novel . So why is it only rated barely  ( 6 / 10 )  ? 
__label__8	After I first saw this ,  I thought ,   " Wow ,  this is the most spectacular movie ,  visually-speaking ,  I've ever seen . "  Since that time ,  I've seen some that topped it but it still ranks as one of the best in that department . I'm just disgusted the long-awaited DVD was so poorly done ,  the quality of this transfer hardly better than the VHS tape .  The jungle scenes are filmed in Cameroon ,  and  " lush "  is the best adjective to describe what you see . Except for jungle sounds ,   " seeing "  is certainly almost everything in the beginning as there is almost no  " hearing ,  "  no dialog until Tarzan  ( Christopher Lambert )  befriends Ian Holm and vice-versa....so be ready for that ,  if you haven't watched this film .   Story-wise ,  all I'll say is this is not the Tarzan many of us came to know in Johnny Weismuller films.....but that's not a complaint . For those craving action ,  and don't care about cinematography as I do ,  you just have to get past that silent introduction period   In this Tarzan version ,  our hero goes back to Scotland  ( his roots )  ,  adapts to that environment  ( for the most part....and a little too quickly for credibility ,  frankly )  and then returns to the jungle without Jane . This is supposedly more true to the Tarzan books ,  written by Edgar Rice Burroughs .  The special effects in here were done by Rick Baker ,  one of the best in the business . Sharp DVD or not ,  this is still a stunning film to view and very interesting throughout its 2 hours and 15 minutes.
__label__8	Ruthless mercenary Bruno Rivera  ( Paul Naschy in peak nasty form )  betrays his pregnant partner / girlfriend Meiko  ( well played by Eiko Nagashima )  in order to have exclusive dibs on a fortune in stolen diamonds . But Meiko manages to seriously wound Bruno before he gets away . Bruno winds up in the swanky chalet of kindly rich doctor Don Simon  ( a fine performance by Lautaro Murua )  . He also attracts the attention of Simon's two hottie daughters :  the fiery Monica  ( luscious Silvia Aguiler )  and the sweet Alicia  ( nicely essayed by the lovely Azucena Hernandez )  . However ,  Bruno soon realizes that something is very amiss about the isolated place and plans to escape as soon as he can . Meanwhile ,  the bitter Meiko tries to find Bruno so she can exact her revenge on him . Naschy ,  who wrote and directed as well as stars ,  concocts one of his strangest ,  most twisted and perverse horror vehicles ever with this little seen oddity . The offbeat plot and mysterious atmosphere become more weird and unnerving as the story unfolds ,  eventually leading to a genuinely startling surprise downbeat ending . This film further benefits from occasional moments of graphic gore  ( watch out for the memorable sequence with one poor guy being devoured alive by vicious flesh-eating pigs !  )  ,  Alejandro Ulloa's slick cinematography ,  and a decent sprinkling of nudity and soft-core sex . Good supporting turns by Roxana Dupre as sassy maid Raquel ,  Pepe Ruiz as amorous playboy Don Serafin ,  and Julia Saly as the deranged Teresa . A pleasingly grim and worthwhile shocker.
__label__8	Pretty good movie about a man and his wife who get caught up in murder and the police officer investigating the case . It starts off marvelously ,  but kind of hits a wall at a certain point . We're sure we know what happened ,  then a tiny plot thread that seems at first like a red herring pops back up and disappoints . Still ,  Clouzot's direction is great ,  and the acting is quite good . Louis Jouvet ,  who also co-starred in Marcel Carné's Drôle de Drame ,  gives the best performance as the clever detective . I wonder if the Coen brothers were influenced by this film when they wrote Fargo . Much like that film ,  the police officer doesn't appear until nearly halfway through ,  and then he becomes almost the focus of the film . There's also a lot of droll comedy surrounding him  ( although sometimes his methods seem sort of fascist ) .
__label__7	Should we take the opening shot as a strange frame ?  ?  ?  I guess we have to . Anyway two women are behind a closing umbrella ,  they walk upstairs to the talent agency and we go with them...and then they are never to be seen again . Okay ,  how come not INSIDE the place ,  at the piano ,  or even outside with the SOUND of the piano ,  then track inside and over ,  a la Hitchcock ?  ?  ?  So I guess Clouzot is already telling us in a not very subliminal manner that we are following a segment of postwar society :  especially how he then uses a Citizen Kane = like song cut up into about five pieces to show the lady singing traveling from the talent agency all the way to her first roses and applause of her Vaudeville debut .  After that we are relentless observers of more or less small disgusting details of a defeated country getting off its war torn tattered knees . And nobody ever handled small disgust better than Clouzot . In fact ,  too bad he never tried Sartre's Nausea . Almost everything we see after the first few minutes makes us ever so slightly queasy . ....okay ,  okay I'm grossly overstating that ,  let's just settle for a general feel of a lot of the film . Look carefully ,  in fact ,  and you will even see one of the cops picking his nose . And in how many films has anyone ever done that . Then there is a very loud nose blowing bit in front of the photographer lesbian by the main cop ,  and notice that she does not ,  literally ,  blink an eye or raise an eyebrow .  The point of all this is an almost feverish immersion in contiguity ,  seemingly ,  until you can smell practically every scene as well as see and feel it .   As for the other aspects of the movie ,  others here have covered them in a lot more detail than I . But forget about the mystery here :  this is the ultimate McGuffin . Clouzot is about as interested in the real killer as those two women coming in out of the rain in the first few seconds of the film and are never seen again . From beginning to end all he wanted to do was follow a bunch of people around ,  not even particularly interesting ones at that ,  and say ,  here look at this woman's twitch ,  that man's hitching of his pants in all their insignificance ,  years and years before Tina Turner was singing we don't need another hero .  \   Even the forced levity of the ending is bleakly done in a dilapidated part of Paris ,  and rather chilly bare walled apartment . With only the couples love for each other to see them through ,  as if to say there must be two or three million like you throughout the city ,  working your fingers off by the day for a little love at night .  From this it was just a short step to Wages of Fear and the ultimate in despair .   They don't even know how to make films like this anymore in the U.S . For that matter ,  they didn't even know how to very much in France then ,  much less now . The relentless detail of gesture makes even the neorealists of Italy look like bad psychologists . Which I guess makes Clouzot a kind of Rosselini on speed .   Very enjoyable nonsense ,  this movie . The only flaw ,  seems to me ,  and as was pointed out by another viewer ,  the lead woman is somehow not quite right . Everybody else in the film is just about perfectly cast.
__label__9	What do you get when you have a tenacious ,  seasoned French police inspector by the name of Maurice Martineau is called to solve a murder case ?  Well ,  simply a very entertaining ,  fun film . The re-mastered black-and-white film  " Quai des Orfevres "  delivers the goods despite romance ,  jealousy and marriage that seem to just get in the way towards the truth of  ' who done it ?  '   Inch by inch ,  technique by technique as seasoned by experience and intuition ,  the patience of this master Inspector etches into the truth -- but of course ,  with the help of a bag full of dirty police interrogation tricks .  Martineau is the centerpiece of this film . The use by director Henri-Georges Clouzot of raucous background music to intensify the drama in grand film noir style is a wonderful wrapper around the visual experience .  Martineau eventually solves the mystery and arrests the culprit . Hey ,  he is good !  !  But alas ,  Martineau ,  too ,  can keep a dark secret in his past . Who is that boy that is perhaps not his son ?   Some things can never get solved -- even beyond the closing credits.
__label__9	Great artists ,  always suffered while they were young . I could mention Mozart and Beethoven ,  but that is not the point .   This movie was made by H-G Clouzot whose family wanted him to succeed in the Law professions .  Its main star is Louis Jouvet who studied and practiced as as pharmacist before becoming  " The Greatest Actor "  and also director of France's Theater before and after WWII .  They both had health problems . Clouzot had TB while young ,  Jouvet had cardiac problems and died on a theater ...  Such events shape the character of men  ( and women ,  of course )  . One might even say that today's Artists are so poor ,  because they had never suffered and fought for their lives .  To me ,  this is the greatest of Clouzot's movies .  " Wages of Fear "  is greater in  " suspense "  ,   " Diabolique "  also has more  " suspense "  and a better plot and is more about  " female evil "  .  Quai des Orfèvres is more human . Clouzot was falsely accused by De Gaulle's entourage  ( mostly communists and Jews )  of collaboration with the Nazis and banned from making films until until De Gaulle left France's Government in early 1946 . De Gaulle came back in 1958 ,  as President .  The main characters are all good souls :  Jenny L'Amour may perform as a  " putain "  on stage ,  but she is not a  " whore "   ( dictionaires make synonyms of those words ,  but they are not the same )  ,  loves her husband ,  and refuses the slight  " advances from her  ( presumably Lesbian )  friend Dora ,  the photographer .  Maurice the husband is jealous and timid ,  but runs away from the scene of the crime . He is a coward because he fell in love with a woman and traded an eventually more upscale career for love ...  Antoine ,  the detective  ( interpreted by the great Louis Jouvet ,  basically a stage actor ,  performs in this French  " Gray "  not Noir ,  as well as E.G . Robinson in  " Double Indemnity "  )  shows flair for pseudo criminals ,  tenderness for a Negro son (  ?  )  ,  and compassion for the true author of the crime ,  because he remembers that is father cleaned the latrines at some nobleman's château !  !   Clouzot was capable of slapping an actor's face in order to put him in the right frame of mind ,  but deep inside he was very human .   I have his horoscope in front of me . He had Venus in Sagittarius which means open-heartedness ,  devotion ,  charity and altruism . For those who do not believe in Astrology ,  my most sincere apologies...
__label__8	Henri-Georges Clouzot's film is quiet an example of the french transition cinema . A film between the realism of the postwar cinema and the full-of-magic and symbolism nouvelle vague . With some spots of the American classic films  ( but not imitating it )  the director tales us a story about love ,  crime and the importance of points of view . We can find great actors too  ( Suzy Delair is impeccable )  .  Is interesting too ,  how we can find aspects of this film nowadays . Quai des Orfèvres inheritance is palpable in Woody Allen tradition . Plunging a crime situation in a picturesque environment . The naive ending is also typical in Steven Spielberg's good-ending films . And finally I would like to point out ,  the deja voo sensation during the photography session between Jenny Lamour  ( Suzy Delair )  and Dora Monier  ( Simone Renant )  in which the first one confess that she thinks her husband is being unfaithful and exactly with the woman who is photographing her . That scene is exactly the one between Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts in Closer  ( Mike Nichols ,  2004 ) .
__label__10	One of the best film I ever saw .  The performance of Louis Jouvet is fantastic . He really  ' fill ' his part ,  and this is wonderful . He's such a good actor that you can't think of anyone else to take his part .   And both Suzy Delair and Bernard Blier are good as standard french people ,  trying to defend themselves in the struggle born with a murder ...  The story is breathtaking and well built . You can feel the ambiance of Paris for that period  ( which is about 1930-40 )  ,  between two wars ... The clubs ,  the old little buildings ,  the neighbors .  All those things contribute to make a great movie.
__label__9	First ,  the obviousas a cop drama crossed with a funny melodrama ,  QUAY  is disconcerting  , straightly independent and a menace to banality . Jouvet's aplomb is put to good use in a tough cop performance immediately noticeable by its vigor and exuberant force ;  his Antoine is not so much a man of intellect ,  but a man of vast life experience and earthly instinct . QUAY  is not subversive in the sense that today's  ( and already yesterday's  )  philistines enjoy using the word . It is Clouzot's most playful hour . He tended to adapt Steeman's books in a satiric note .  ( It's said that Clouzot was a big reader of detective novels . )  As a director ,  Clouzot's firm hand is successful .   It is not a mystery or a thriller , but a satirical look at a Parisian couple and at the police's proceedings . Those accustomed with Clouzot's masterpiece LES DIABOLIQUES might find slightly disconcerting the multiplicity of things ,  styles ,  elements in QUAY .Here Clouzot speaks about many things ,  about a couple ,  and a hidden love story  ( Simone Renant's for Blier )  , about the entertainment's world and about old spinsters ,  about police techniques and an old bitter cop with a boy to raise ,  etc ... There is a note of exuberancenot only in Jouvet's performance ,  but also in the film's conception .   Quay is a realistic crime drama made as a satire . It offers an outstanding performance by Jouvet as a tough police inspector . Antoine is an old cop with an adventurous past  ( he fought in Africa  , but did not climb the ranks ' stair because of his independent behaviors )  ;  he lives with his son ,  a schoolboy ;  at work ,  Antoine is tough and merciless ,  an able inspector ,  bitter ,  intelligent and harsh . It is a role of great gusto ,  very picturesque . Jouvet composed his character of several defining traitshis clothes ,  his expression ,  his funny accent ,  his brutality ,  and that mocking air .Antoine is not made to look more clever than plausible ;  when he interrogates Blier ,  Antoine makes mistakes  , and his talent is presented like the talent we meet in real lifemixed with errors and lacunae and defects . Antoine's talent is one that comes also from experience ,  from daily observationit's not the almost supernatural  _ divinatory genius of almost all the famous detectives .  QUAY  is multifacetedit is a realistic crime drama ,  and also a satire and a melodrama . One can consider it among the first  _ filmic forays into the legendary toughness of the French police . Long ago Eastwood's and Wayne's harsh cops ,  there was Antoine .   The title is interesting ,  suggesting that this is a movie about the police ,  not about a case or a mystery .   As craftsmanship ,  Clouzot was perhaps the best and sharpest in France  ( in the way that Welles was )  . QUAY  is very true to Clouzot's naturea sardonic comic ,  sharp observations ,  much psychology ,  sharp ,  unsparing irony . The man was firstclass when he filmed somethinghe knew what to shoot ,  what to choosesee the introductory scenes of this film ,  with Jenny Lamour's great stage success . Each scene is memorably ,   _ exemplarily shot . Clouzot's technical ,  stylistic aptitudes were amazing . His style is inventive ,  satirical ,  sharp ,  extremely limpid ,  ingenious .   Jouvet's style was exuberant ,  powerful ,  vehement .  ( Some disliked it precisely for these features . As he had been a great stage actor ,  his movie style was deemed as too theatrical ,  etc ... )  His Antoine is a fine example of what was meant by composing a role ,  by a composition .   Jouvet had a very peculiar physiognomymuch like a menacing bird of preysomewhat like Van Cleefyet much subtler ,  nobler and more intelligent and distinguished . Jouvet had this predatory ,  ferocious air ,  and it is useful here ,  as he performs an old tough cop . One of QUAY 's sides is that it is a Jouvet recital . He is immediately recognizable ,  identifiable by the quality of his play  ( I see that many ,  watching this flick ,  do not know it is a Jouvet moviewhich is an astounding quality in itself )  .   Fresnay and Jouvet are the two French actors that I admire the most ;  the first one was revealed to me by a Renoir drama  ( the famous one )  ,  while Jouvet by a Carné comedy . I was charmed to see that Clouzot gave leading roles to both of them .  To end ,  a word about Steeman ;  he wrote the novel used by Clouzot  ( who had previously adapted another Steeman novel ,  as a Fresnay comedy )  . Steeman was an old school mystery writer ,  in the Wallace vein . He became quickly outdated with the new hardboiled fashions . When I was 11 I have read one of his thrillers ,  and liked it much.
__label__7	This film is so lovingly made you want to be part of it forever . The flics are straight but not without malice ,  the goods are transparent and evildoers are hardly there . Even the  " cabaret "  are so naive they'll make you daydream with nostalgia in comparison to anything available on TV . Blier is fine ,  if a bit one sided . Louis Jouvet is perfect ,  you just can't have a better copper . He has the best line :   " My dad cleaned other people's dirt ,  and I do the same "  . Susy Delair is unbearable ,  but I guess in part it's the songs ,  wardrobe and hairdo . Simone Renant ,  on the contrary ,  makes a great femme fatale ,  if a bit silent . I didn't realize she may be a lesbian as IMDb user dbdumonteil and others rightly suggest.
__label__9	Clouzot followed Le Corbeau ,  where no one knew who was penning the poison thus everyone was suspected ,  with another masterpiece ,  Quai des Orfevres four years later in which we know from the outset  ( or think we do )  whodunnit . Top-billed Louis Jouvet doesn't appear for forty minutes by which time Clouzot has established a rich milieu of Music Hall ,  music publishers ,  etc and a fine cast of colourful characters ;  Angela Lansbury lookalike  ( Lansbury appeared in Woman of Paris that same year )  Suzy Delair scores as the chanteuse whose desire to improve her lot inspires the jealousy of her husband / accompanist Bernard Blier who follows her to the home of an elderly letch only to find he is already dead . From here things go seriously wrong ,  his car is stolen before he leaves the premises so his pre-arranged alibi is out the window whilst meanwhile ,  unknown to him ,  his wife confesses to the murder to the photographer neighbour ,  a closet lesbian in love with her ,  who volunteers to return to the crime scene and retrieve Delair's scarf and as long as she's there , thoughtfully wipes her prints of the murder weapon ,  a champagne bottle . At this point investigator Jouvet gets involved and from then on it's a case of keeping the plates spinning in the air . Clouzot's output was relatively small but virtually all of it was ,  as Spencer Tracey said in another context ,   ' cherce ' ,  with Le Salaire de peur and Les Diaboliques still to come . In short this is a must for French cinema buffs.
__label__8	Is it a murder mystery ?  Is it a police procedural ?  Is it a back-stage look at seedy French music halls ?  Quai des Orfevres is all of these ,  but more than anything else it's an amusing comedy of infidelity ,  jealousy and love ,  set in post-WWII Paris . It may be surprising that Henri- Georges Clouzot ,  the director of such grim films as Le Corbeau or such suspenseful nail- biters as Diabolique and The Wages of Fear ,  is the director of this one . Clouzot ,  however ,  was a shrewd film-maker .  " In a murder mystery ,  "  he tells us ,   ' there's an element of playfulness . It's never totally realistic . In this I share Hitchcock's view ,  which says ,   ' A murder mystery is a slice of cake with raisins and candied fruit ,  and if you deny yourself this ,  you might as well film a documentary . ' "  Quai des Orfevres is a wonderful film ,  and it's no documentary .   Jenny Martineau  ( Suzy Delair )  is an ambitious singer at music halls and supper clubs . She's a flirt ,  she's sees nothing too wrong with using a bit of sex as well as talent to get a contract . Her stage name is Jenny Latour . And she really loves her husband ,  Maurice Martineau  ( Bernard Blier )  . Martineau is something of a sad sack . He's her accompanist and arranger . He's a bit balding ,  a bit chubby and jealous to a fault . Then we have their neighbor ,  the photographer Dora Monnier  ( Simone Renant )  . She's blond ,  gorgeous  ( think of Rita Hayworth )  and capable . She and Martineau have been friends since they were children together . Dora ,  however ,  is definitely not thinking just of friendship when she looks at Jenny . Then comes along Georges Brignon  ( Charles Dullin )  ,  a wizened ,  rich and dirty old man ,  who often has Dora take  " art "  photographs of his young female proteges whom he poses himself . He offers a contract for a film to Jenny ,  and suggests a dinner at his home to discuss the details . Jenny is more than willing . Maurice is furious and forbids it . Jenny shouts right back at him ,   " You're jealous of the rich !  Well ,  I want my share of their dough . I'm all for royalty !  "   " You're dad was a laborer ,  "  Maurice shouts back .  " So what ?  Under Louis XV ,  I'd have been Madame de Pompadour !  I'd have heated up their tights !  "    And after Brignon is found dead with a smashed champagne bottle next to his bleeding skull ,  there's Dora to try to make things safe for Jenny . But wait . Inspector Antoine gets the case . Antoine  ( Louis Jouvet )  is a tall ,  tired ,  middle-aged bachelor with sore feet . He has seen it all . He served in  " the colonies "  with the Foreign Legion and returned with an adopted baby and malaria . The child is now about eight-years old and Antoine dotes on him . One of the first things Antoine discovers is not only did someone brain Brignon with a bottle ,  someone shot him in the heart . Who did it ?  Before long Jenny ,  Maurice and Dora all are making up alibis ,  lying and ,  at one or another point ,  confessing . How will Antoine discover the murderer ?  Will we have a chance to see some great music hall songs sung by Jenny Latour ?  Everything becomes clear ,  but only with time and Detective Antoine's persistence . We are left with many kinds of love leading to all kinds of motives ,  from hair-trigger jealousy to longing glances...and all played with a nice mixture of Gallic amusement .   Clouzot takes us to a Paris of seedy but not threatening neighborhoods ,  to downtrodden music publishers where tunes are played on the piano for buyers ,  to restaurants with discrete private dining rooms . Most of all ,  he takes us to the music hall where Jenny Latour often performs . We can see Jenny as she sings ,  with couples in the seats and single men wearing their coats and hats in standing room . And everyone smokes . The first third of the film ,  in fact ,  takes place largely in this milieu . With Jenny singing about  " Her petite tra-la-la ,  her sweet tra-la-la ,  "  we follow her from trying out the song at the publishers to a rehearsal to a saucy performance with Jenny in a feathered hat ,  a corset ,  gartered stockings and not much else .   Delair ,  Blier and Renant all do wonderful jobs ,  but it Louis Jouvet who holds everything together . He was a marvelous actor who disliked making films . The stage was his world ,  and he took on films only if he happened to like the director and to make money to finance his stage work . Jouvet was tall with a long face and broad cheekbones . He was not conventionally handsome but he had what it takes to dominate a scene . For a look at how skillfully he could play comedy ,  watch him in Drole de Drame . He's a fascinating actor . At one point he says ,   " I've taken a liking to you ,  Miss Dora Monnier . "   " Me ?  "  she asks .  " Yes . Because you and I are two of a kind . When it comes to women ,  we'll never have a chance . "  Jouvet brings all kinds of nuances to that line ,  from rueful regret to a gentle amusement.
__label__9	H.G . Cluozot had difficulties working in France after he had made  " Le Corbeau "  in 1943 which was produced by the German company and later judged by French as a piece of anti-French propaganda . Louis Jouvet ,  an admirer of Clouzot's work ,  invited him to direct a thriller  " Quai des Orfevres "  where he played an ambiguous police inspector investigating a murder that happened in Paris Music Hall . Without each other knowledge ,  the seductive cabaret singer Jenny Lamoure  ( Suzy Delair )  and her jealous piano-accompanist husband Maurice who is madly in love with her  ( Bertrand Blier ,  father of director Bertrand Blier )  trying to cover up  ( without each other's knowledge )  what they believe to be their involvement in the murder ?  Enters tenacious policeman  ( Louis Jouvet )  who is determined to discover the truth . Jouvet practically stole the movie with wonderfully cynic and sentimental in the same time performance .  " His character ,  his eagle-like profile and his unique way of speaking made him unforgettable . "   " Quai des Orfevres "  ,  witty and atmospheric observation of human weaknesses was a great comeback of H.G . Cluozot ,  the fine director ,   " French Hitchcock " .
__label__7	The extraordinarily adorable Suzy Delair plays a statuesque performer obsessed with succeeding in the theater . Her husband and accompanist ,  played by Bernard Blier ,  is a composed but jealous man . When he finds out in a less than preferable way that his flashy wife has planned a rendezvous with a lecherous old businessman with the intention of advancing her career ,  he loses all control and threatens the businessman with murder . Now ,  at that point ,  I must stop describing the film to you because it skates on such thin ice with its twists ,  revelations ,  ambiguities and suspense that to imply any of it would endanger it . I am not sure how good or bad that is for this French police procedural emanating from the song- and-dance community ,  though it is certainly interesting that what we do know throughout is who did not do it . We just don't know who did .  The story depends upon the procedure of following clues ,  where ideal alibis fail and where cautiously created fabrications and deceptions disintegrate . Interestingly ,  this is a suspense film in which suspense is generated in spite of the knowledge one would traditionally think too much too soon .  Quay of the Goldsmiths is the least dark of Henri-Georges Clouzot's films . It's nowhere near as sinister as the shocking Les Diaboliques ,  as tragic as the riveting Wages of Fear or as eery as Le Corbeau . Maybe it is due to the vibrance of the dance halls and theater settings of 1940s France ,  which all work as the milieu of this crime thriller .  Clouzot both understands and approves of his characters ,  even the more rotten ones ,  where he has more of a vindictive streak with his other films . Where he may have had understanding for the scheming women in Les Diabolique or the truck drivers who sink to the level of risking horrible death in order to oust themselves from miserable life in The Wages of Fear ,  there isn't necessarily support or agreement on the part of the filmmaker ,  for these are characters who plainly made the direct decisions that determine their fate . All the characters in this more settling film have scenes and moments that endear us to them ,  even the harsh ,  cold detective played by Louis Jouvet ,  who worries about his young adoptive son amid all the trouble and despair that happens in his life at any time with the drop of a hat .  There is humor and unabashed sexiness ,  the latter mostly on the part of Delair ,  that neutralize the pressure to a degree . Clouzot was quietly practicing his craft ,  patient till he made his unrelenting later films ,  in which he would permit his audiences no pardon from the tension.
__label__8	A nice ,  humorous mix of music hall  ( in the first third mostly )  and police procedural mystery as the various suspects ' stories start to collapse . The final exposure of the murder may come as a surprise if you don't watch closely . A gritty look at Paris of the time . You can ignore the final scene  ( the Hollywood ending )  . Louis Jouvet is best as the police inspector who seems to be just passing through ,  but is really on top of things.
__label__10	The Director loves the actress and it shows . The actress inhabits the character ,  whom we love at first sight and sound . The character loves her jealous unprepossessing husband and he loves her . His childhood friend secretly loves his wife and the fact that his friend is a beautiful woman makes the love tragic and ironic . His wife is jealous of his childhood friend and thinks her attentions are out of secret love for her husband .  Then there is a murder and the investigating police lieutenant ,  who loves only his bi-racial son ,  and resents being taken from his company by the above characters ,  who have had some unpleasant contact with the deceased and are all lying to one degree or another ,  unravels the mystery with some of the most precise and authentic procedural detail ever captured on film .  And then there are the atmospherics of a post-war Paris ,  where coal is in short supply ,  music is filled with erotic longing and wistful memory ,  and innocence has long ago been washed away by the rain .  All of this in a milieu of magicians whose tricks don't always work ,  dogs who walk on their hind feet and express music criticism ,  hungry news reporters and exhausted cops .  And then there are many of the finest actors of their generation who have been through some very bad years directed by ,  to come full circle ,  a man who is in love with his lead actress and who ,  with full justification ,  was a respected friend of Picasso .  I've seen this film often and I love all of them and it.
__label__10	First of all , there is a detective story :  " légitime défense "  by Belgian Stanislas André Steeman whose  " l'assassin habite au 21 "  Clouzot had already transferred to the screen in 1942 , with Pierre Fresnay and the same actress Suzy Delair.Steeman complained about Clouzot's adaptation for both movies.The movie from 1942 was excellent , but the  " detective story "  side had been kept , so why complaining ? As for  " Quai des orfèvres "  , Clouzot was now in a new phase of his brilliant career.After having directed  " le corbeau "  and been blacklisted , he had a lot more to say than a simple whodunit.Steeman complained essentially about the poor detective ending , which I will not reveal of course , but Clouzot focused on the social vignettes , on his characters's psychology , and he did not give a damn about the puzzle à la Agatha Christie.By doing so , he becomes the genuine predecessor of CLaude Chabrol who has always been closer to him than to Alfred Hitchcock whom he admires much though . Suzy Delair has great screen presence , and you will love the song she really sings ( she was a singer too )  " avec son tralala " .Bernard Blier gives  , as ever , a sparing of gestures and words performance , and he really pulls it off .Two characters are particularly interesting and disturbing : the first one , Dora , the photographer : she takes pictures of female models  , and Clouzot , by subtle touches , reveals us she's a lesbian.Of course , the word is never uttered ( How could it be in 1947 ?  )  The police chief  ( fabulous Louis Jouvet )  tells her :  " You and me , WE are not lucky with women . " The portrait of this cop is very detailed : we learn a lot of things about him , not necessary connected with the Delair / Blier plot : he's a widower  , with a son he adores and who runs into school difficulties , particularly in geometry.So we get to know all the characters in depth.One of the most important manifesto of post-war French cinema.
__label__9	This is an exceptional picture with so much to recommend it . The acting and writing are terrific and there are lots of great twists and turns in the plot . As a French  " Noir "  film ,  its language is certainly a lot earthier than its American counterparts ,  but to me this just added to the realism . Additionally ,  I liked how non-glamorous everyone was--particularly the husband and the lieutenant . About the only negative ,  and the reason the film gets a 9 and not a 10 ,  is because there was a glaring plot hole . Like another famous French film ,  Drôle de Drame ,  the confusion between the cops and the accused could easily have been settled in the beginning ,  but the characters made rather stupid decisions . For this ,  you just need to suspend disbelief and keep watching--the payoff is well worth the wait .  This is simply one of the finest French films I have seen . Period.
__label__10	 " Quai des Orfevres "  ,  directed by the brilliant Henri-Georges Clouzot ,  is a film to treasure because it is one of the best exponents of French film making of the postwar years . M . Clouzot ,  adapting the Steeman's novel ,   " Longtime Defence "  ,  shows his genius in the way he sets the story and in the way he interconnects all the characters in this deeply satisfying movie that ,  as DBDumonteil has pointed out in this forum ,  it demonstrates how influential Cluzot was and how much the next generation of French movie makers are indebted to the master ,  especially Claude Chabrol .  The crisp black and white cinematography by Armand Thirard has been magnificently transferred to the Criterion DVD we recently watched . Working with Clouzot ,  Thirard makes the most of the dark tones and the shadows in most of the key scenes . The music by Francis Lopez ,  a man who created light music and operettas in France ,  works well in the context of the film ,  since the action takes place in the world of the music halls and night clubs .  Louis Jouvet ,  who is seen as a police detective ,  is perfect in the part . This was one of his best screen appearances for an actor who was a pillar of the French theater . Jouvet clearly understood well the mechanics for the creation of his police inspector who is wiser and can look deeply into the souls of his suspects and ultimately steals the show from the others . In an unfair comment by someone in this page ,  Jouvet's inspector is compared with Peter Falk's Columbo ,  the television detective . Frankly ,  and no disrespect to Mr . Falk intended ,  it's like comparing a great champagne to a good house wine .  Bernard Blier is perfect as the jealous husband . Blier had the kind of face that one could associate with the man consumed with the passion his wife Jenny Lamour has awakened in him . Martineau is vulnerable and doesn't act rationally ;  he is an easy suspect because he has done everything wrong as he finds in the middle of a crime he didn't commit ,  but all the evidence points to the contrary .  The other great character in the film is Dora ,  the photographer . It's clear by the way she interacts with Jenny where her real interest lies . Simone Renant is tragically appealing as this troubled woman and makes an enormous contribution to the film . Suzy Delair ,  playing Jenny ,  is appealing as the singer who suddenly leaps from obscurity to celebrity and attracts the kind of men like Brignon ,  the old lecher .  The film is one of the best Clouzot directed during his distinguished career and one that will live forever because the way he brought all the elements together.
__label__7	Quai des Orfevres takes too long getting going ,  with Clouzot so enamored of his back-stage milieu that he is almost in danger of forgetting the story . However ,  once it does ,  it's Clouzot at his best . Bertrand Blier  ( father of Bertrand Blier and co-star of his Buffet Froid )  is the worldworn pianist who married beneath himself and who plans to kill the seedy studio mogul with designs on his wife only to find that someone has beaten him to it . Not only that ,  but his carefully planned but clumsily executed alibi falls to pieces ,  not least when a thief steals his car at the murder scene  The film really kicks into life with the arrival of Luis Jouvet's police inspector ,  a rather wonderful creation half Alistair Sim in Green for Danger and half world-weary Maigret with better dialog . In a neat running gag ,  his investigation is constantly conducted at the top of his voice against chaos and noise ,  whether it be the noisy typewriters of the police station or a loud rehearsal . The police station itself is a wonderfully realistic creation ,  a wealth of chaotic and telling small details that makes Steve Bocchco's once revolutionary 80's US cop shows look like antiquated museum pieces by comparison .   If Suzy Delair is a rather unconvincing femme fatale ,  the supporting cast more than compensate ,  with the beautiful Simone Renant a standout as the lesbian photographer in love with her from afar and constantly mistaken for Blier's lover by Delair and other interested parties  ( only Jouvet ,  similarly unlucky with women ,  understands and genuinely sympathises )  . With great black and white photography by Armand Thirard ,  this is a terrific little thriller with a nice twist ending and a lovely scene with a cab driver reluctantly identifying Renant in a police station .  ( Trivia note :  Pierre Larquey ,  who played the playfully philosophical Dr Vorzet in Le Corbeau ,  turns up in smaller roles as a cab-driver in both Quai and Les Espions . )   The Criterion DVD is quite superb - great picture quality plus an illuminating extract from a French TV show featuring interviews with Clouzot ,  Blier and Renant.
__label__8	And I love it !  !  !  Wonder Showzen will pick up a cult audience and once it's canceled ,  the DVD sales will go though the roof . This is a very funny show in it's own ways . It's a parody of children's shows ,  namely Sesame Street . Our puppet characters consist of Chauncy ,  a yellow furry monster with a hat ,  whose our host . Clarence is a blue lizard like thing that does his own segments where he goes out on the streets . Him is a weird dog like thing that refers to himself in the third person . Wordsworth is the smart one whose brain always shows . Then there's the newscaster and the pink puppet . It's a very funny show ,  not really as nasty as you'd expect ,  but more the situations . They take 7 year olds out on the street ,  tell them what to say ,  and have them make mean jokes that they don't understand . My favorite segments are Clarence's videos ,  especially when somebody doesn't want to be filmed . I prefer TV Funhouse ,  which was a similar show ,  but this is still a very funny show that I hope lasts for years to come .  My rating :  *** 1 / 4 out of **** . 30 mins . TV MA.

__label__10	I love this show . My girlfriend was gonna get an abortion until we both watched Wonder Showzen one night . Luckily ,  she killed herself before the baby was born . Though technically I think it was considered a murder-suicide .  My first thoughts upon seeing Wonder Showzen ?  Now I know what God watches when He jerks off all the time .  Wonder Showzen is to television what a toaster in the bathtub is to my self-esteem .  You know how George W . Bush makes speaking gaffes all the time ?  Tyler wouldn't . Tyler's good . Tyler cuts his nails . He's Tyler . He's good . Tyyyllerrr...
__label__10	Seeing this show gives me respect for MTV ,  though i imagine that MTV sees this random ,  edgy material as its main selling point and is much less concerned with the pertinent truths it expresses .   I write and play music for a living and this show gets me really emotionally riled up . For me ,  Wondsershowzen serves a completely distinct function from most TV . Instead of dulling or distracting the senses ,   ( which can be often really nice at times )  ,  it awakens my spirit of right and wrong . It makes me very uncomfortable ,  but in a very comforting way .   I don't think a lot of viewers absorb most of this show's content ,  but if they do ,  kudos to television viewers everywhere.
__label__7	I'm torn about this show . While MOST parts of it I found to be HILARIOUS ,  other parts of it I found to be stupid and simply shock for shock sake . The off the wall parody of some of the cartoons are brilliant as indeed are a lot of the scenes with the children . However ,  I don't think it's clever getting little children to say rude things . It's not that I think  " oh poor children ,  they're being exploited "  - it's just that it's really not clever !  !  It's something that ANYONE could do ,  therefore making it as simple and pointless as making a paper airplane . In order to make this show better they would have to stick to the natural responses from children ,  which I think can be funnier than the scripted at time .   By far the funniest part of Wonder Showzen is Clarence ,  the blue puppet who wonders around the streets talking to and annoying strangers . It's really funny and it's mostly improvised . Seeing him in a long scene about the importance of patience test the patience of an EXTREMELY patient man ,  was by far the funniest scene in my opinion .   You should watch this show though because all in all it's very funny ,  even if it is stupid at times.
__label__10	I was plagued by nightmares involving Sesame Street and the Muppet Show during my childhood . I loved the programs ,  but when I slept ,  I'd dream about muppets not unlike the ones on TV...but not quite the ones on TV .  They would speak gibberish and laugh and sing while eating each other and killing each other . They'd take a bite of their cute felt flesh and it would tear apart followed by arterial bleeding . NICE !  But that was the past...I LOVE THIS SHOW !  I saw Peter Jackson's MEET THE FEEBLES years ago and wondered why there wasn ; t similar work out there . Well here it is ,  as sick ,  twisted and somehow socially potent the old Hobbit's vision .  If you like this show ,  and you haven't seen MEET THE FEEBLES ,  get it on Amazon or some such film source . You're in for a treat .  By the way ,  Clarence would totally kick Triumph's dog ass.
__label__7	This is not a film is a clever ,  witty and often heart touching movie . It's a retrospective of a failed relationship between Michael Connor  ( Michael Leydon Campbell )  and his estranged Irish girlfriend Grace Mckenna . Michael down on his luck decides to make a documentary replaying his whole relationship and what went wrong . He exploits his friendship with an actor he met at the gym Nadia  ( Nadia Dajani )  who he gets to play Grace . The concept of this film is very original . Michaels relationship is shown from every point whether it's a high or low . Michael Leydon Campbell pulls off a fantastic performance that makes you want to help him find Grace . If fact most of the characters pull off great performances except the puzzler . The puzzler is needed to move the plot along yet seems too surreal to exist in a coffee shop . His monologues are often overdrawn and pointless . This is proved when he says  " Out of this chaos ,  we're all trying to create order . And out of the order ,  meaning . But in reality there is no such thing as meaning . Something only has meaning if we make it have meaning . "   The commentary saves this movie . The commentary is done in the vain of This is Spinal Tap and has Michael and his brother explain the problems they had while making the film . Michael offers a very funny self conscious commentary that makes for some very good belly laughs .  Overall I'd give this movie a 7 / 10.
__label__10	I've tried to reconcile why so many bad reviews of this film ,  while the vast majority of reviews are given a rating of between 7 and 10 . The reason may be this film is kind of hard to describe in a positive review ,  although a few have done that quite nicely already . This film is confusing ,  depressing ,  and doesn't have a happy ending . I still gave Pola X a rating of 10 ,  because it is basically for me literature and art combined on film . That is really my favorite kind of filmmaking . I've only seen two of Carax's films :  this one and Mauvis Sang . As with this film ,  I'm being somewhat pretentious when I call this one of Carax's best films- but I am . Carax has a minimalist style . If that type of film does not appeal to you and is boring ,  then it would be best not to watch this . But Pola X was less minimalist than Mauvis Sang ,  so it had quite a lot of intensity for a thriller- at least for my taste . I found it quite interesting and absorbing . The two lead roles did an excellent job acting .  ( I mean the lead and the young woman he thought was his half sister . )  Catherine D . is always great ,  but her role was not very large or significant in the story . But everyone did a fine job . I thought the cult stuff was great . It may have not been very believable ,  but that is due to its being rather abstract . There is a lot going on between the lines in this film . This is a very Freudian psycho-thriller.
__label__10	Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that Pola X is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever . Seriously . If I could have figured out some way to climb inside my video monitor ,  I would have thrashed Pierre to within an inch of his life . No one has the right to be that self absorbed and that stupid ,  both at the same time ,  except maybe Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights . After spending 134 minutes with Pierre ,  I need a large glass of brandy . Never have I been so angry at a main character . Ok ,  having said that ,  Pola X is a stunning movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes I've ever seen in any film....which means another piece of brilliant filmmaking....and I'm talking graphic here ,  by the way . Pola X will beat the hell out of you ,  though ,  so make sure you're up for it if you decide to watch it.
__label__7	Leos Carax has made 3 great movies :  Boys Meet Girls ,  Mauvais Sang ,  Les Amants du Pont Neuf . In fact those films were not that great but it has the violence of youth ,  the beauty of juvenile wilderness . Carax in these three movies was well aware of what cinema was ,  but he tried to make his own vision of the art ,  without thinking about about all he have seen ,  but using it and melting it into his times . Pola X is a very different movie because Carax made Les Amants du Pont Neuf ,  a monstruosity of 20 millions dollars ,  a film that has destroyed everything on its way . After such a movie you can't do another one in the same point of view . So Leos Carax has to changed ,  and he did . The movie isn't as beautiful as its first ,  it's more reasonable ,  no more studio ,  no more dreamed Paris ,  Carax has entered at last reality . It's not clean anymore ,  it's not poetic characters . Carax have become a romantic in the german sense of it.
__label__10	I watched Pola X because Scott Walker composed the film score and I admire his music a lot . Frankly ,  I expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent French movie . I was wrong . The vision of the film quickly managed to engage my attention to the fullest - starting with the opening sequence ,  which shows black and white footage of military airplanes throwing bombs at graves at the sounds of music and Scott Walker's beautiful wailing voice . The film explores the identity crisis of Pierre  ( Guillaume Depardieu - a brilliant choice for the role )  and his consequential  ( self- ) destruction . The story is divided into two parts  the first depicts Pierre's carefree life in a beautiful house in the French countryside and the second follows his utter personal disintegration after he abandons everything and moves to Paris to live in squalor with his supposed half-sister . Both parts contain some amazingly stunning photography  the first very colorful and bright ,  the second utterly gloomy and nearly apocalyptic - adding up to a true aesthetic feast . Pola X is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience.
__label__7	I agree with  " johnlewis "  ,  who said that there is a lot going on between the lines in this film . While I do think the pacing of this film could be improved ,  I do think that the complexity of the relationships between the characters is fascinating .  Examples  :    Pierre is going to marry his cousin ,  even though his love for her seems very cousin-y  ?    Pierre and his stepmother have a rather...curious relationship .  Pierre ,  Lucie ,  and Thibault seem to have a triangular relationship ,  and the actual points to the triangle are not quite certain ...  Lucie's brother is a bit of a eunuch ,  or is he  ?    And Isabelle ,  who is she really  ?  ?    Overall ,  I think it was worth my time . An interesting film ,  and one that makes me want to read Melville.
__label__10	Pola X is a beautiful adaption of Herman Melville's  ' Pierre ;  or ,  the Ambiguities' . The comments on here surprise me ,  it makes me wonder what has led to the overwhelmingly negative reaction .   The shock value is the least appealing thing about this film - a minor detail that has been blown out of proportion . The story is of Pierre's downfall - and the subsequent destruction of those around him - which is overtly demonstrated in his features ,  demeanour and idiolect . The dialogue and soundtrack set this film apart from any other I have seen ,  and turn a fundamentally traditional storyline with controversial twists into an unforgettably emotional epic .  I can't stress enough the importance of disregarding everything you have heard about this film and watching ,  as I did ,  with an open mind . You will ,  I hope ,  be rewarded in the same way that I was . I felt on edge and nervous from around the half-hour mark ,  however the film is far from scary in any traditional sense . It will leave you with 1 , 000 thoughts ,  each of them at once troublesome and thrilling . I know I'm gushing here ,  but I feel the need to make up for the negative perception of this film . It's the best I've seen all year.
__label__7	This movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end . Not that that is bad ,  it was done to illustrate character trait degression of the main character . Consequently ,  if you are not into tragedies ,  this is not your movie . It is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile . If you liked Dostoyevsky's  ' Crime and Punishment ,  "  you will probably like this if only for the comparisons . The intriguing question that the movie prompts is ,   " What is it that makes a renowned writer completely disregard his publicly-aproved ideas for another set ?  "  The new ideas are quite opposed to the status quo-if you are a conservative you will not like this movie .   Besides other philosophical questions ,  I must admit that the movie was quite aesthetically pleasing as well . The grassy hillsides and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start . Also ,  there was use of coloric symbolism in representing the mindstate of the main characters . If these sorts of things do not impress you ,  skip it . Overall I give this movie a 7.
__label__9	No one would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius ,  but what we wonder about is :  is he an insane genius ?  So many people hated this film !  I am normally the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive ,  boring ,  disgusting and pretentious films  ( such as the horrible recent film  ' L'Enfant ' and the pointless and offensive  ' Feux Rouges ' )  . But strangely enough ,  I actually think that  ' Pola X ' is an amazing film ,  made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft ,  and containing remarkable performances . The film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I have ever seen on screen before . But then ,  Carax is extreme ,  that we know . The film also contains what I consider way over-the-top Trotskyite or Anarchist fantasies and wet-dreams ,  what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing Scott Walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels . Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a château  ( whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve ,  and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath ,  by the way )  . But he suddenly  ' snaps ' completely when he discovers that his deceased father ,  a famous diplomat ,  had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by Deneuve as an inconvenience . This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair ,  expressionless face ,  and little ability to speak French coherently . Depardieu then transforms himself into a  ' class hero ' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption ,  and lives in squalor and extreme poverty ,  while scorning a vast inheritance . He then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister ,  which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people ,  though I have no objection to it ,  as I think people are far too hysterical about sex ,  especially in America ,  where apparently it never happens . The intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful ,  if depressing ,  hyper-melodrama . The differences between Carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme French films which I think are pretentious and disgusting are  ( 1 )  that Carax is an excellent filmmaker ,  and  ( 2 )  he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful ,  if harrowing ,  extreme emotional condition ,  whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background . Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous ,  but I don't agree . I believe Carax was genuine ,  and was not making an exploitation picture at all . It is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who ,  for all I know ,  may be a complete madman ,  but I believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
__label__7	At times I really wonder when I look at the comments here it seems as if most people have seen a completely different film than I have . I've just seen it ... and liked it . Not in the way ,  that it made me happy ,  but in the way of having seen a good film !   The film needs some patience ,  yes . And yes ,  the main character is REALLY annoying ,  but that I'm sure is by intention .  Maybe it really makes a difference if you watch this film in a cinema or at home . Most people watch films at home like they are listening to elevator music . This movie definitely doesn't fit as background noise .  And no . Good directing doesn't mean having five laughs or explosions a second . Good directing means following your subject and keeping the story and actors together . And while that doesn't work out perfectly ,  at least I think it works quite good .  I liked the photography and sets ,  even if they brink on the surreal at times . The opening scene is really special .  I also liked the acting  Guillaume Depardieu is NOT playing Pierre . He is acting the role of a Pierre who is himself playing a role !  Pierre is not the romantic hero that he so hard tries to be ,  he is a presumptuous and self-righteous idiot ,  a downright weakling who by and by harms all the people he claims to protect . That even his love for truth is simply a pose is beautifully demonstrated by his ongoing lying and not even once asking questions or explaining himself .  People are wondering where this or that person came from and other stuff :  No character who is seen for more than two scenes is left unexplained ,  there is enough information scattered throughout the film on everyone .  And even the strange building begins to make sense as soon as the target practicing is seen :  Remember that Isabelle fled from a war zone - and obviously this is a refuge for fighters in a civil war ,  most likely Bosnia  ( which was still going on ,  when the film was produced )  . At least that's what is hinted at by the story Isabelle tells Pierre when she first meets him and by the later scene where Pierre shows Isabelle the book with his father on the cover ,  which is surrounded by books on Bosnia.
__label__9	When Melville's  " Pierre ;  or The Ambiguities "  hit bookstores in 1852 ,  his first publication since  " Moby Dick "  a year earlier ,  the public response was similar to that found among the IMDB reviews of  " POLA X "  . Newspapers even published headlines like :   " Melville Insane !  "  which ,  of course ,  he wasn't . But ,  when one compares the writing styles found in  " Moby Dick "  and  " Pierre ,  "  one finds in the latter a sharp departure from the simple and often declamatory style found in the former . Clearly ,  he was mimicking the overly florid style of the now-forgotten Victorian Romances that were easily outselling his immortal  " Moby Dick . "  He was not content ,  however ,  to turn out the sort of product that his publishers wanted ,  and that surely would have sold . His version of a Victorian romance was a twisted ,  cynical one ,  perhaps ,  but brilliant in its synthesis . The alternate title :   " The ambiguities "  is quite appropriate . As Pierre searches for ,  and thinks he finds ,  truth ,  we become more and more uncertain what and whom to believe . As he searches for happiness ,  he becomes more and more miserable .   " POLA X "  is a fascinating adaptation of this novel ,  set in modern or nearly modern France . Though ,  in some ways ,  it leaves little to the imagination ,  and shows us graphically the incestuous relations that Melville could only hint at ,  the ambiguities which make the novel and its message so alluring are perfectly in tact . The questions it raises are ones that few films have thought to ask ,  yet the answers are left to the viewer .  I recommend a reading of the novel ,  which is much shorter than  " Moby Dick ,  "  before seeing this movie . I hope more people discover this tantalizing film.
__label__9	A rare exception to the rule that great literature makes disappointing films ,  John Huston's beautiful farewell to life and the movies is almost entirely true to the narrative and the spirit of James Joyce's short story ,  a tender meditation on love ,  death and time expressed in the events of a Twelfth Night party in middle-class Dublin circa 1910 . Unpromising as the material might appear ,  the film succeeds by its willingness to tell the story on its own quiet ,  apparently inconsequential terms ,  rather than force a conventional cinematic shape of plot points and dramatic incidents upon it . Only once is the wrong note struck ,  when old Miss Julia  ( a trained singer and music teacher whose voice is supposed to have been cracked by age ,  not shattered )  sings so badly that the audience burst out laughing when I saw this at the cinema . Fortunately ,  the mood of hushed and gentle melancholy is re-established in plenty of time for the moment of revelation between the married couple Gabriel and Gretta Conroy in a hotel bedroom as snow begins to fall outside . It's a sad story ,  I suppose ,  but the kind that leaves you feeling better ,  not blue . Especially recommended as a date movie - for people in love who aren't frightened of confronting the sweetness and sadness of life.
__label__10	I first saw this film in Austria when it first came out ,  and I was entranced by it . It is a passionate and deeply moving work that should be experienced by all connoisseurs of motion picture art . What a shame that it has never been released in DVD format . Perhaps one of these days that will be rectified ,  as it would be a shame indeed if one of the best films ever made was forgotten and left to fade away in some film vault forever .  Why is it that  ' B ' movies like  ' American Wedding ' and  ' Eurotrip ' get widescreen and fullscreen releases ,  and often a special edition with multiple commentaries and extras ,  while great art pieces like  ' The Dead ' are all but forgotten ? 
__label__10	This is possibly the most perfect film I have ever seen - in acting ,  adaptation and direction . It is self-contained and of a kind ,  so there is no point in saying that it is better or worse than other great films ,  just that it can stand by itself as a perfect work of art .  And it was fun watching confused horror fans getting up and walking out ! 
__label__9	John Huston ,  actor and director better known for more robust fare such as  " The Misfits "  and  " African Queen ,  "  directs his daughter ,  Angelica Huston ,  in what would be his last film . Indeed ,  the film was released after Huston's death . Based on James Joyce's novella of the same name ,   " The Dead "  tells the quiet story of a New Year's celebration in 1904 Dublin . Huston ,  his cast and his screenwriters ,  including his son Tony ,  have created a gem of a movie . The novella is among Joyce's finest works  ( as well as being the only one that is filmable )  . The film is a tribute to Huston's genius . He has taken a small , beautiful story and has made a small ,  beautiful movie . Donal McCann and Angelica Huston shine  ( although  " shine "  is too showy ,  too flashy a word to describe their quiet ,  understated performances )  .  " The Dead "  reflects the Huston family's love for Ireland and is ,  in its own quiet way ,  a fitting final movie for a legend.
__label__10	Writers and directors ,  by the nature of their craft ,  stand back a frame from the action in their work to show insights about characters and situations . Here ,  Huston and Joyce have stepped back a bigger frame yet to show us the ultimate view of what it means to be human . Until it's very end the movie appears to be about nothing much ,  the kind of typical circumstances that fill every day life . It is not until the end of the very final scene that we realize that it is in fact about everything .  It is not possible to watch this final scene without simultaneously feeling pity ,  and also deep affection ,  for oneself and the rest of fellow beings.
